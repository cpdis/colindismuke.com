A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

The Sleep Consultant
--------------------

[A work of fiction by Robin
Sloan](https://desert.glass/archive/sleep-consultant/):

> Disrobing in a hotel is special: the puddling of pants or skirt onto a
> floor unsullied by the rest of your life. The wall-to-wall window at
> my room’s far end is uncovered, and I leave it that way. I believe in
> the city dweller’s compact, and as such I must offer to the anonymous
> world the same view that I myself have taken in. (To clarify: any use
> of magnification, optical or digital, violates this compact, which
> exists between humans alone: slivers of pink, no taller than crescent
> moons, regarding each other across gulfs that are very importantly
> unbridgeable. Once, in downtown Los Angeles, I saw the glint of a lens
> across Flower Street, and oh, how I glared. There is a man still
> crouched beside his window in a tower there, immobile, turned to
> stone.)

Jackpot
-------

A [tale of desperation, greed, leverage, and wealth
inequality](https://marker.medium.com/jackpot-694063c4d867):

> When detectives entered the vault, they were stumped by what they
> found — or rather, what they did not find. There were no tasered
> guards with their hands bound: Round-the-clock watchmen had worked
> their shifts without incident. The vault itself showed no sign of
> forced entry: The 60-centimeter-thick, steel-plated walls were intact.
> Security cameras and trip alarms operated normally. Bank officials
> struggled to explain why they had waited hours to call the police. A
> lot of money was unaccounted for. And the suspects had left behind
> only one piece of physical evidence: a bag full of lottery tickets.

Human Progress
--------------

There has been a lot of criticism of Mark Zuckerberg’s annual challenge
for this year, all of which I think is perfectly valid. However, I think
this conversation with [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/)
and [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/) is great on its own
merits—[I highly recommend you give it a
watch](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/a-conversation-with-mark-zuckerberg-patrick-collison-and-tyler-cowen/).

Genius
------

Kanye, Bon Iver, Francis and the Lights, James Blake, Frank Ocean,
Chance the Rapper—musical perfection, all influencing each other.

Fast Internet
-------------

It’s hard to overstate how much a fast Internet connection can change
someone’s life. I hope that projects from Facebook and Google actually
deliver on their promise to provide a connection to everyone in the
world. A [story about a town with some of the fastest Internet in the
U.S.](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-one-traffic-light-town-with-some-of-the-fastest-internet-in-the-us)

> The effort took six years, at a cost of fifty thousand dollars per
> mile. “Someone has to build to the last mile,” he said. “The big
> telecom companies aren’t going to do it, because it’s not economical
> and they have shareholders to answer to. We’re a co-op. We’re owned by
> our members. We answer to each other.” The grants they got, he said,
> were a matter of good timing and good luck.

and

> “You can’t make everybody magically go from making twenty-five
> thousand dollars a year to seventy-five thousand. Broadband is not
> going to create higher-paying jobs for everyone in the county. But it
> can help education. It can help entertainment. It can help the
> economy. It can help health care. And I even think that people’s
> mind-set—how they feel about themselves—can be improved just by not
> always saying ‘We don’t have nothing here.’ In this case, we have
> something to be proud of. We have something everyone else wants.”
