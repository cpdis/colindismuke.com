A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

🚰

[This story](https://www.topic.com/going-down-the-pipes) should make you
feel great the next time you’re about to take off.

> A few years ago, a controller guiding ten jets in a great curving arc
> toward Newark suddenly lost his frequency just as he had to turn the
> pilots onto the final approach to the runway. Watching in helpless
> horror as his planes careered farther and farther off course, the
> controller rose from his chair with an animal scream, burst into a
> sweat, and began tearing off his shirt. By the time radio contact was
> reestablished—and the errant planes were reined in—the controller was
> quivering on the floor half naked, and was discharged on a medical
> leave until he could regain his wits.

### Hong Kong No. 1

[Nick Taber
examines](https://quillette.com/2019/08/19/how-the-hong-kong-protestors-tactical-brilliance-backed-beijing-into-a-corner/)
what has made the ongoing protests in Hong Kong successful:

> The protesters are fiercely resisting what most see as China’s
> inexorable absorption of Hong Kong. Given the Chinese Communist
> Party’s (CCP) clear interest in eroding much of what makes Hong Kong
> distinct from the mainland, its sheer power and resources, and its
> track record for how it handles dissent, such resistance seems naive,
> even suicidal, to many. And yet, for Hong Kongers, the desire to
> preserve their freedom and society isn’t something they are
> particularly willing to give up. Moreover, China’s rapid turn towards
> totalitarianism since Xi came to power only drives home the need for
> Hong Kong to resist this encroachment.

### Hong Kong No. 2

Maciej Cegłowski with [another report from the front lines in Hong
Kong](http://idlewords.com/2019/08/a_week_with_no_tear_gas.htm):

> …the protesters have weaponized a civic virtue of Hong Kong, a sense
> of general responsibility and social order that extends beyond
> individual desires. I have noticed that protesters who talk to the
> press about their beliefs express them in the language of care. One of
> the greatest risks in the protests is arrest, which can have
> career-destroying consequences. The frontliners form a literal barrier
> between the police and the other demonstrators, putting themselves in
> danger to protect the great mass of people from arrest and beatings.
> They see that role as protective, even when it involves violent
> confrontation with the police.
>
> In turn, the peaceful faction recognizes the moral and physical burden
> that the frontliners have to bear, and supports them with supplies,
> moral support, and by showing up at the protests in numbers. While the
> frontliners are fewer in number, their voice carries weight, because
> they bear a disproportionate share of the risk. There is a respect
> between the two sides, and a sense of mutual protection. Despite the
> lack of central leadership, the factions coexist and mostly succeed in
> maintaining their cherished value of unity.

### Systemic

This investigation, by Lizzie Presser, [looks at the legal system that
has enabled generations of land owning African Americans to be stripped
of their most valuable financial asset and of their
identities](https://features.propublica.org/black-land-loss/heirs-property-rights-why-black-families-lose-land-south/).
If you find the idea of systemic racism hard to imagine, this report
makes it very concrete.

> Between 1910 and 1997, African Americans lost about 90% of their
> farmland. This problem is a major contributor to America’s racial
> wealth gap; the median wealth among black families is about a tenth
> that of white families. Now, as reparations have become a subject of
> national debate, the issue of black land loss is receiving renewed
> attention. A group of economists and statisticians recently calculated
> that, since 1910, black families have been stripped of hundreds of
> billions of dollars because of lost land. Nathan Rosenberg, a lawyer
> and a researcher in the group, told me, “If you want to understand
> wealth and inequality in this country, you have to understand black
> land loss.”

### Monopoly

It seems difficult to write about Amazon and monopolies without the word
count [approaching novella
length](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox).
Chris Gillett [looks at how Amazon is trying to beat antitrust
enforcement before it
happens](https://palladiummag.com/2019/06/08/how-amazon-is-beating-antitrust-before-it-happens/).

> Amazon is also obsessed with guarding against internal and external
> threats to growth, primarily organizational sclerosis and antitrust
> enforcement. These are the interests around which Amazon—and every
> facet of the company—was devised.

### Endurance
