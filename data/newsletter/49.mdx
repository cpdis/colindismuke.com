## Wealth

[Alex Tabarrok

a
[post](http://glineq.blogspot.com/2020/02/historical-wealth-how-to-compare.html)
by Branko Milanovic that argues against comparing wealth over long time
scales.

> Bezos and Gates clearly are poor *relative to people in the
> future* who can choose to vacation on Mars. It seems absurd to me to
> think otherwise. Jeff Bezos has four children. Suppose one of them had
> cancer. If he could, do you think Bezos would hesitate for one minute
> to spend a billion dollars buying the medicine that will be available
> to an ordinary American in the year 2050? How much would Bezos pay for
> an extra 10 years of life? What about an extra 100? How much for a
> bionic eye, a dozen extra points of IQ, or freedom from Alzheimer’s
> disease?

## Life

Gabe Lozano’s [eulogy for his
wife](https://humanparts.medium.com/musings-on-life-love-and-death-rachel-lozanos-story-22333b46a89b).

> I suspect it’s only natural to think of what one would do if they knew
> the end was near. Unfortunately, Rachel and I now have firsthand
> knowledge. In practice, the end of my wife’s life felt like a highly
> accelerated version of the exact same unconditional love pursuit we’d
> been exploring for 14-and-a-half years. With the scariest moment of
> our lives just hours away, we first reverted to simple joys — like
> cuddling, eating more ice cream, and watching the latest episodes
> of *This Is Us* and *A Million Little Things*. Once settled in, we
> forced our minds to reimagine the bounds of unconditional love by
> circling back to a near-final draft of this eulogy* — *soaking in
> every single detail; processing the impact of death; and providing one
> another reassurance that in spite of an utterly incomprehensible
> situation, we were in this together.
>
> On the morning of February 27, we glanced into one another’s eyes a
> final time, smiled, and each said, “I love you. Thank you for
> everything.” Rachel then closed her eyes and we leaped into the
> terrifying unknown.

## COVID-19 🦠

These are the best, most informative, and sobering articles and reports
on the spread of COVID-19 and what we can do to stop the pandemic:

- [\#FlattenTheCurve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/)

- [Covid-19, your community, and
  you](https://www.fast.ai/2020/03/09/coronavirus/) from the data
  scientists at fast.ai.

- [Why You Must Act
  Now](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca)
  does an incredible job at explaining how things are changing
  exponentially and what can be done to stop the spread.

- [Patient
  31](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html),
  a super spreader in South Korea.

- [On finally doing what has to be
  done](https://theprepared.com/blog/lessons-from-lockdown-on-finally-doing-what-has-to-be-done/)
  is written by one of the creators of the The Prepared, a website
  about prepping.

  > So if I’m having such a hard time facing what needs to be done,
  > and getting ready for exactly this type of scenario is my
  > full-time job, then I have a lot of sympathy for the great many
  > people who are in total denial that Covid-19 actually a big deal.

And a few tweet threads that bring a level of humanity that you don’t
usually find in articles or on the news:

1/ I may be repeating myself, but I want to fight this sense of security
that I see outside of the epicenters, as if nothing was going to happen
"here". The media in Europe are reassuring, politicians are reassuring,
while there's little to be reassured of. \#COVID19 \#coronavirus

From a well respected friend and intensivist/A&E consultant who is
currently in northern Italy: 1/ ‘I feel the pressure to give you a quick
personal update about what is happening in Italy, and also give some
quick direct advice about what you should do.

THREAD: In U.S. we face two alternative but hard outlooks with
\#COVID19: that we follow a path similar to South Korea or one closer to
Italy. We probably lost chance to have an outcome like South Korea. We
must do everything to avert the tragic suffering being borne by Italy
