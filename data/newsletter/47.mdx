A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

## Rehabilitation

Who would have thought that treating inmates like actual humans and
teaching them valuable life skills might help fight the incarceration
problems we have in this country? [A profile of the Rikers Coffee
Academy](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/business/rikers-island-baristas.html).

> The barista program (it’s unpaid at Rikers) and a handful of others
> like it nationwide give inmates a new set of professional skills and a
> way to pass the time, but they also reflect a growing theory in the
> criminal justice system that the \$88 billion coffee industry can
> soften the blow of incarceration and provide a critical link to
> employment. A job — even one that pays \$10 to \$15 an hour, roughly
> the wage range at Starbucks — can help end the cycle of crime and
> recidivism, experts say.

## Simple

[Great, in-depth
analysis](https://macro-ops.com/lessons-from-24-years-of-operating-bowl-america-inc-bwl-a/)
of Leslie H. Goldberg’s (CEO of Bowl America, Inc.) annual investor
letters by Brandon Beyloe of Macro Ops.

> Bowl America is the Chick-Fil-A of bowling centers. Excellent customer
> service is a large competitive advantage. It’s also one of the hardest
> to achieve. Top-notch customer service requires employees to buy-in to
> the company’s long-term vision.
>
> Not only that, employees must enjoy working for the company. Reward
> your employees and they’ll reward the business.

and commit the world to memory, as i knew things would never be the
same.

## Cancelled

Eugene Wei writes an incredible essay once every couple of months. [This
essay](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/1/7/john-wick-and-cancel-culture)
comparing _John Wick 3_ to [cancel
culture](https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/30/20879720/what-is-cancel-culture-explained-history-debate)
is a must read if you’ve seen the movie.

> _John Wick 3_ begins directly after the events of the previous film,
> and at first, all seemed familiar. But after having spent two films
> worth of time in this universe already, sometime midway through the
> third film, it dawned on me. The rules of this film franchise mapped
> with uncanny precision to something that everyone had been complaining
> about to me for years now: cancel culture.

## Fire

There are a [tremendous number of fires (still) burning in
Australia](https://flowingdata.com/2020/01/08/visual-guide-for-the-fires-in-australia/).
However, like the US, Australia is a very big continent so the impact
might not be felt quite as heavily on the West coast as it is on the
East coast (_a la_ fires in California having little impact on New
York).

## Simple pt. 2

Like Bowl America, there is something about businesses that do one
simple thing exceedingly well that resonates deeply with me. [Josh
Brown](https://twitter.com/reformedbroker) [talks about getting his
wife’s engagement ring
repaired](https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/01/08/client-for-life/).

> All of this is happening without a single dollar changing hands right
> now. It’s a store taking care of a customer who bought something in
> the past and will now likely buy more in the future. They’ve actually
> transformed my wife from a customer to a client. A client for life.
