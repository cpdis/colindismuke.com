A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Hard

### Harder

> The RemoveDEBRIS satellite, created by a team at the University of
> Surrey, has pulled off its most demanding experiment yet. It fired a
> harpoon at 20 meters a second at a separate satellite panel that it
> was holding at the end of a boom. As you can see in the video above,
> the harpoon succeeded in stabbing and capturing the item. Last year
> the team also accurately [fired a giant net at a
> satellite](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/612174/satellite-uses-giant-net-to-trap-spinning-bit-of-space-junk/)
> to capture it, and tested out a lidar- and camera-based system for
> identifying space junk.

### Cognitive Dissonance

[Arthur Finkelstein and George Birnbaum are both
Jewish.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hnsgrassegger/george-soros-conspiracy-finkelstein-birnbaum-orban-netanyahu)

> Finkelstein and Birnbaum created a Frankenstein monster that found a
> new life on the internet. In that stew are the resentments for his
> assault on communism, and allegations that he’s a communist;
> anti-Jewish slurs and charges he’s a Nazi; and above all the old mix
> of European anti-Semitism.

### Insatiable

[There’s very little that can stop
Amazon.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/when-amazon-went-from-big-to-unbelievably-big/582097/)

> …Amazon now has 288 million square feet of warehouses, offices, retail
> stores, and data centers. In 2017—the biggest growth year for the
> company’s properties—alone, it added more square feet of building
> (74.6 million) than the company had total in 2012 (73.1 million), when
> it was *already* the largest online retailer in the world. Amazon has
> added more building space from 2016 to 2018 than it did in all the
> rest of its history. Go back a little further in time, and the growth
> is even more astounding: Amazon has *48 times* the square footage it
> did in 2004.

### Future Medicine

[The stomach doesn't have any pain
receptors.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/health/oral-pill-insulin.html)

> The test device, called Soma, is shaped like the tortoise’s shell.
> Inside is a miniature post made of insulin. After the tiny device
> positions itself against the stomach wall, the post pops out and
> injects insulin. The device then travels through the colon and
> eventually is eliminated by the patient.
