A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Routine

The detail toward the end of [Nico Muhly’s music
diary](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n20/nico-muhly/diary) are pretty
exceptional.

> The primary task, I feel, is to create a piece of art that is better
> than the same amount of silence; I would prefer to sit silently
> thinking for ten minutes than to listen to certain pieces of music,
> and therefore feel that it is my duty as a composer to occupy the time
> of the listener.

### Inequality

If you’re left-leaning, you’ll be nodding your head; if you’re
right-leaning, you’re head will be exploding. Everyone can agree that
this is a [pretty good
summary](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/consolation-prizes-pareene) of
Axios, though:

> ...to render the gist of things in a rhetorical register a bit less
> evasive than Axios’s trademark semaphoric house style: Be
> Smart—liberal democracy is in retreat, millions more people live in
> authoritarian states, and right-wing ethnonationalism threatens to
> sweep across vast swaths of the world, but, in the short term, your
> portfolio should continue to beat expectations.

### Debt

A [good
summary](https://www.epsilontheory.com/modern-monetary-theory-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-national-debt/)
of modern monetary theory and a warning from Ben Hunt at Epsilon Theory.

> I can see this narrative storm system forming off the coast of Africa.
> I can see it heading west across the Atlantic. I know the warm waters
> of the election cycle Gulf are going to feed it until it becomes a
> monster. I know it’s going to make landfall.
>
> I can’t stop it and you can’t stop it. But forewarned is forearmed.
>
> We can prepare for the storm.

### Ballet

### Aggrieved

This is long but I think Casey Newton has the [best
analysis](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/lessons-from-the-covington-catholic-debacle-155488)
of the Covington Catholic debacle.

> **Yes, everything is Gamergate.** In 2014, Kyle Wagner wrote a spot-on
> essay about how the lessons of Gamergate — the campaign of targeted
> harassment against mostly female journalists, cloaked in the language
> of press criticism — predicted much of our current moment. He writes:
>
> "There is a reason why, in all the Gamergate rhetoric, you hear the
> echoes of every other social war staged in the last 30 years: overly
> politically correct, social-justice warriors, the media elite, gamers
> are not a monolith. There is also a reason why so much of the rhetoric
> amounts to a vigorous argument that Being a gamer doesn’t mean you’re
> sexist, racist, and stupid—a claim no one is making. Co-opting the
> language and posture of grievance is how members of a privileged class
> express their belief that the way they live shouldn’t have to change,
> that their opponents are hypocrites and perhaps even the real
> oppressors. This is how you get St. Louisans sincerely explaining that
> Ferguson protestors are the real racists, and how you end up with an
> organized group of precisely the same video game enthusiasts to whom
> an entire industry is catering honestly believing that they’re an
> oppressed minority. From this kind of ideological fortification, you
> can stage absolutely whatever campaigns you deem necessary."
>
> You see this kind of response in the conservative reaction to the
> Covington videos, which essentially says: these kids were just
> exercising their First Amendment rights, and the real issue here is
> that the intolerant left and mainstream media have come to demonize
> them and chill their free-speech rights. They also complained that the
> Native American elder, Nathan Phillips, had walked toward the teens
> initially — and not been sought out by them, as some had first
> reported. This is the basic mechanic by which the Covington teens can
> get a sympathetic audience on the Today show, and a possible
> invitation to the White House. If you’re a news consumer, it’s helpful
> to understand this playbook as you watch it play out during every
> major conflict. And if you’re a news producer, it’s helpful to
> understanding so that you don’t yourself get played.
