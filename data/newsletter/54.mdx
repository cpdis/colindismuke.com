I’ve landed in Hong Kong after flying from Paris CDG, via London
Heathrow. I now have to wait \~8 hours before I get my \#COVID19 test
results and thus have ample time to tweet about my experience.

Coincidentally, as she was flying to Hong Kong, my family was flying
from Houston, Texas to Perth, Australia. Our experience had some
similarities but on a much shorter time scale. From the time we stepped
off the plane till we arrived in our quarantine hotel room: 3 hours.

## Reopening

A [clear-headed
essay](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
from Erin Bromage on the risks of reopening to quickly.

> **So now let’s get to the crux of it. Where are the personal dangers
> from reopening?**
>
> When you think of outbreak clusters, what are the big ones that come
> to mind? Most people would say cruise ships. But you would be wrong.
> Ship outbreaks don’t even land in the top 50 outbreaks to date.
>
> Ignoring the terrible outbreaks in nursing homes, we find that the
> biggest outbreaks are in prisons, religious ceremonies, and
> workplaces, such as meat packing facilities and call centers. Any
> environment that is enclosed, with poor air circulation and high
> density of people, spells trouble.
>
> Some of the biggest super-spreading events are:
>
> - Meat packing: In meat processing plants, densely packed workers
>   must communicate to one another amidst the deafening drum of
>   industrial machinery and a cold-room virus-preserving environment.
>   There are now outbreaks in 115 facilities across 23 states, 5000+
>   workers infected, with 20 dead.
>
> - Weddings, funerals, birthdays: 10% of early spreading events
>
> - Business networking: Face-to-face business networking like the
>   Biogen Conference in Boston in March.
>
> Erin is Australian and flew there in early March, read about it

## Weak

Peter Welch of Still Drinking with [a few strong
words](http://www.stilldrinking.org/kill-the-weak).

> It is not virus or the lockdown that has crushed my spirit. It isn’t
> even facing my worst fear every day, all day. Years ago, I wrote “[We
> cannot dismiss everyone who supports Trump as stupid or
> evil.](https://medium.com/@peterhuntwelch/the-american-experiment-is-failing-eab7bdd327d7)”
> Maybe it was true then, but I regret my words. We may now dismiss
> them. Personally, since the White House thinks we’re in a “war”
> against coronavirus, I would like to see a large portion this murder
> cult hanged for war crimes. I would go to that execution. I would
> cheer. I would shout for more.
>
> Because I no longer believe I live in a country with greedy assholes,
> or ignorant people trying to get by the same way I do. I no longer
> believe that it is my task to better myself and find harmony with
> people I cannot understand. I believe I live in a country full of
> dangerously stupid monsters.
>
> This is the only way I can make sense of the world anymore. I’m tired
> of trying to explain the simplest concepts to people who refuse to
> understand things like gravity, vaccination, carbon, and that hurting
> others is bad. If they’re monsters, I can stop trying. Doesn’t
> understand basic compassion? We don’t expect that from monsters. Tells
> doctors treating patients to go back China? I would definitely expect
> that from a monster. Holds up a sign reading “sacrifice the weak” for
> reasons I can barely fathom. But nobody knows what motivates monsters,
> and there’s no reason to ask.

## Spray

This is from a month ago but the three paragraphs below were arresting.
Nicholas Kristof [brings the medical crisis to life in a very real
way](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-hospitals-bronx.html).

> For health workers, intubation is nerve-racking because it causes the
> virus to spray out from the lungs into the air. In this case, the
> procedure was performed in a room on the edge of the hot zone with
> negative air pressure, so that the virus would remain in the room. A
> plastic box was placed over the patient’s head, and the
> nurse-anesthetist put her arms through holes in the box to perform the
> intubation.
>
> The patient was put to sleep and paralyzed, and a device was inserted
> into her mouth to lift the epiglottis and make way for a tube that was
> passed through her vocal cords about 10 inches down to her lungs. The
> outside end was then connected to a ventilator, which pumped oxygen
> in.
>
> Because it would be ghastly to wake up unable to speak with a tube
> down one’s throat, patients are sedated so that they do not rip out
> the tube; doctors say that for some reason, Covid-19 patients seem to
> require more sedation than other patients. To be safe, their hands are
> also tied down.

## Response

Entrepreneur Matt Blumberg [wrote a
play-by-play](https://www.onlyonceblog.com/2020/03/state-of-colorado-covid-19-innovation-response-team-part-i-a-different-kind-of-startup)
of his time leading Colorado’s COVID-19 Innovation Response Team. Very
interesting perspective as the crisis unfolded at the state level.

## Risk

Morgan Housel wrote a very personal piece called “[The Three Sides of
Risk](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/)”.
Take a little time to read it.

> Tail-end events are all that matter.
>
> Once you experience it, you’ll never think otherwise.
