A few things of note from around the Internet this week…

### Determined

[Gwen Jorgensen’s
transformation](https://www.outsideonline.com/2346696/gwen-jorgensen-chicago-marathon)
from Olympic gold-medal winning triathlete to marathoner:

> Still, if Jorgensen could pull it off, Johnson says, “It would be the
> most amazing athletic feat of my lifetime.” One he believes even her
> greatest naysayers are internally rooting for. “Part of you wants to
> believe it’s possible, like it’s reminding us of what we dreamed as a
> little kid. That’s the goal: to dream big.”

### Stress

[The rest of the Pavlov
story](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/fool-me-three-times-and-i-give-up/):

> Pavlov spent months testing the dogs after the flood. His work shows
> him to be nearly as interested in what psychological trauma did to
> their behavior as the famous drooling before the flood.
>
> He summed up what the flood did to his dogs, and how it applies to
> humans: Different conditions productive of extreme excitation – such
> as intense grief or bitter insults – often lead to profound and
> prolonged loss of balance in nervous and psychic activity.
>
> Hard-core stress sticks around and changes behaviors that were
> ingrained before the stress occurred.

### Contradiction

I would be surprised if most of the politicians and public figures
championing inhumane immigration policy don’t have [stories exactly like
this](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a23471864/devin-nunes-family-farm-iowa-california).

> Why would the Nuneses, Steve King, and an obscure dairy publication
> all conspire to hide the fact that the congressman’s family sold its
> farm and moved to Iowa? I went to Sibley to find out. Things got a
> little strange.

### Smart

[Interesting look at employees completely automating their
jobs](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/agents-of-automation/568795/).
I would counter that if you have the ability to obviate your job
entering data or some other relatively menial task then you should
probably be employed doing something else.

> Self-automators are acting alone, deciding when and how to replace
> their own job with code. Ideally, automation decisions would happen
> collectively, with colleagues’ and peers’ input, so, the gains could
> be evenly distributed.

### Rage

[Jessica Valenti on
Kavanaugh](https://medium.com/s/jessica-valenti/kavanaugh-is-the-face-of-american-male-rage-eded62c5eda9):

> And with that, the hearing stopped being about Blasey Ford’s
> experience or even Kavanaugh’s fitness for the job, and instead became
> a stage for broader and bitter male resentment — furious over the
> seemingly new expectation of accountability, and raging over not
> immediately being given what was promised to them.
>
> That Blasey Ford was so accommodating and kind throughout the
> day — repeating multiple times that she just wanted to be
> helpful — only drove home this feeling: Even as women calmly and
> expertly explain the ways in which men have hurt us, our pain is
> immediately drowned out and glossed over by men’s belief that they
> should not have to answer to us, of all people.
