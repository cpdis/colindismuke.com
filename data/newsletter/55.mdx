The whole country needs to stop right now and listen to Killer Mike.
He’s verbalizing what a lot of us don’t know how to express

closest and most dependable allies. Rendered speechless. Just watch.

Things spiraled out of control today in Seattle when police tussled w/
protestors over an umbrella. I have synced up/edited together a FB live
stream and an overhead shot from Reddit so you can see exactly how it
went down. Warning: it is upsetting.

but they also left his body on the street for 12 hours. say his name.

This man isn't a protester. He was just a guy sitting at a traffic light
when cops shot his car with a tear gas round. He got out to yell at them
because his pregnant wife is in the vehicle. So they opened fire on
them.

Different angle on 1️⃣1️⃣1️⃣ out of Indianapolis From this view you can
see the cop grope the woman he's restraining, that's why she breaks away
Then of course a half dozen cops beat her for not wanting to be groped

A few other things from around the Internet this week:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
-----

This [pretty closely
mirrors](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/my-government-mandated-quarantine-at-a-five-star-hotel)
our experience staying at The Westin Perth during our quarantine.

> Packaged meals from a third-party catering company were dropped at the
> door three times a day. Breakfast was often yogurt and cereal, and
> lunch, a sandwich and a salad; dinner could be spaghetti or chicken
> curry. While both the cost of the room and the meals themselves were
> covered by the Australian government, Ailsa and her husband could pay
> out of pocket for wine, beer, and groceries, which could be delivered.
>
> Security guards were stationed on every floor to make sure no one left
> their rooms for any reason. Government workers stood in for hotel
> employees, answering phones and fielding guest questions. A nurse
> called guests each morning to inquire after their health, and to ask
> whether they were experiencing any symptoms of the coronavirus.

Repeat
------

Kieran Healy [on the enormity of the data
available](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2020/05/21/the-kitchen-counter-observatory/)
about COVID-19.

> Every day begins in the same way. I get up. I make my coffee. I look
> at the data. Everything about this is absurd. To begin with, there’s
> the absurdity that everyone with a job like mine faces each day.
> Locked down at home with the kids, trying to get things done, unable
> to properly teach, write, or think. The household is like a little
> spacecraft, drifting in the void. Occasionally you venture outside to
> get supplies, or to check the shields. I find the days are speeding up
> now, because even though things drag from moment to moment, each
> twenty-four hour period is essentially identical. It reminds me of
> when my children were newborns. It’s a daily slog that, in retrospect,
> fuses into a gray blob almost impossible to recall in any sort of

Future
------

Om Malik with [a little optimism about the
future](https://mailchi.mp/om/why-very-tech-downturn-has-a-silver-lining?e=6cb0858bee).

Elegant adaptation of a Kurt Vonnegut short story in which an investment
banker learns that his working-class client is hiding a million dollar
fortune for perplexing reasons. The ending is perfect.
