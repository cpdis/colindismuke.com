A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Piano

David Kotok in the [excellent Cumberland Advisors
newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/cumber.com/cumberland-advisors-market-commentary-doc-holliday-jay-powell-donald-trump-the-piano?e=fdf6aec7bc):

> We think the president’s attack on the Fed was wrong. It hurts his
> political party. It hurts the country. And it helped tank the markets.
> The Trump-Navarro US-China trade war is worsening, and markets don’t
> like it. Markets now fear that Trump has undone the beneficial effects
> of his repatriation policy, tax cuts, and deregulation initiative.
> What started out on a positive path is now a war between the two
> largest economies of the world. That war now seems to be intensifying.
> Remember: In a shooting war the guns are pointed at each other; in a
> trade war the guns are pointed inward. Nobody wins.
>
> The warning on the saloon piano was apt. Don’t shoot the player who is
> doing his best. (And especially don’t try to shoot the player if it is
> Doc Holliday.)
>
> Mr. President. You will do what you want. That is continually made
> very clear by your behavior. The country will determine who is loco.
> And history will report the results

### Pathetic

Upon any examination at all, the stereotype that women are more
“emotional” than men is a laughable. [Sady Doyle nails
it](https://medium.com/s/powertrip/male-pain-is-male-power-3db257db15e4):

> What Kavanaugh displayed on that witness stand was not “emotion.” It
> was weakness. And that weakness — and our presumed obligation to
> protect him — helped land him one of the nation’s highest seats of
> power. In time, we learned that he had been coached to show anger and
> that what looked like a public meltdown was a carefully calibrated
> performance, the result of White House counsel telling Kavanaugh to
> “show the senators how he really felt.” Kavanaugh’s testimony was a
> conscious invocation of fragility to avoid consequences, the
> all-too-familiar spectacle of a man holding the world hostage to his
> pain.

### Simple

[This is how you run a fast food
business](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2018/10/10/exclusive-in-n-out-billionaire-lynsi-snyder-opens-up-about-her-troubled-past-and-the-burger-chains-future/):

> In-N-Out and Snyder get high marks for a reason: good pay and career
> development. Restaurant workers, or “associates” in In-N-Out speak,
> make \$13 an hour, versus the \$9 to \$10 or so that’s typical at most
> national competitors, including McDonald’s and Burger King. Part- and
> full-time restaurant workers can enroll in dental, vision and life
> insurance plans through the company, and full-timers can get health
> insurance and paid vacation, accruing time off after two weeks of
> employment.
>
> The average In-N-Out manager has been with the company for 17 years
> and makes \$163,000, more than the typical California dentist,
> accountant or financial advisor. Managers get profit-sharing, too.
> “They’re simulating an ownership mentality at the restaurant,” says
> John Glass, a restaurant-industry equity analyst at Morgan Stanley.
> “That manager now has skin in the game.”

Bonus: the next location in the Houston area is [going to be
Katy](https://houston.eater.com/2018/10/17/17987828/in-n-out-burger-katy-opening).

### Start

With the way that the world operates today, there is a decent chance
that, despite all of the current consternation, the relationship between
Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world returns to the status quo.
However, I think that [Ben Hunt makes an excellent
point](https://www.epsilontheory.com/saudi-arabia-and-the-common-knowledge-game/):

> But I’ll say this. Once common knowledge has been created, it’s
> impossible to uncreate. It’s impossible to go back to the plausible
> deniability and bribes and renditions of the ubiquitous private
> knowledge world. MBS will never again have a “reformer” cartoon. He is
> now a Bond villain. That’s the common knowledge, and behaviors will
> change as a result. No more nights on the town with The Rock. No more
> warm meetings with Oprah. No more vacations with Jared. No more
> softball interviews with Tom.
>
> Is that a lot? No. But it’s something. It’s a start.

### Tough

Lionel dropped from 2nd at the Ironman World Championship in 2017 to
30th this year. It’s rare to see this much self-reflection from a
top-tier pro-athlete.
