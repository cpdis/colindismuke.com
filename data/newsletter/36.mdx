A few things of note from around the Internet t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶w̶e̶e̶k̶ the past two
months:

**A 14-Year-Old Girl**
----------------------

[🤦](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/youtubes-newest-far-right-foul-mouthed-red-pilling-star-is)

> “Susan, I’ve known your address since last summer,” Soph said,
> directly addressing YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. “I’ve got a Luger and
> a mitochondrial disease. I don’t care if I live. Why should I care if
> you live or your children? I just called an Uber. You’ve got about
> seven minutes to draft up a will. ... I’m coming for you, and it ain’t
> gonna be pretty.” A far-right child comedian threatening to murder the
> executive of the video site that has made her famous, for trying to
> protect her from pedophiles: the state of YouTube in 2019.

Ultrawomen
----------

[I bet this makes some very fragile men very
upset](https://thewalrus.ca/when-male-runners-lose-to-women/).

> “Running economy and fatigue resistance are places where women seem to
> have a bit of an edge,” says Bearden. “And, with those two factors,
> the longer the distance of the race, the more important those two
> factors are.”

Indexing, etc.
--------------

A [conversation with NYU Professor Aswath
Damodaran](https://elmfunds.com/aswath-damodaran-interview/) who writes
the great [Musings on Markets](http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/)
blog.

> If I thought more of equity research analysts, I would worry more
> about indexing. If I really thought equity research analysts actually
> went out and collected information and did research and unearthed
> stuff about companies we did not know, then I’d be worried about
> indexing taking away that research. But unfortunately, that’s not what
> I see equity research analysts doing. They listen to management spout
> platitudes about the company, and mostly they take them at face value.
> They take an adjusted EBITDA, they slap a pricing multiple on it, they
> call it research. That’s not digging up anything about a company, so
> nothing is lost by those equity research analysts being pushed out of
> the business.

😢 Hard
------

I think there’s something to be said about the [truly monumental
challenge](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/technology/facebook-ai-schroepfer.html)
of moderating all of the content that is uploaded and shared on the
Internet every day.

> But few could have predicted how Mr. Schroepfer would react to our
> questions. In two of the interviews, he started with an optimistic
> message that A.I. could be the solution, before becoming emotional. At
> one point, he said coming to work had sometimes become a struggle.
> Each time, he choked up when discussing the scale of the issues that
> Facebook was confronting and his responsibilities in changing them.
> “It’s never going to go to zero,” he said of the problematic posts.

Dark
----

Drew Magary’s brain exploded and he [lived to talk about
it](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/the-night-the-lights-went-out-1834298070).

> Not only did my wife have to deal with my sudden and terrifying
> predicament by relocating the entire family to New York for a month,
> but she also had to assume all the parenting duties (my youngest son,
> naturally, came down with strep throat immediately) AND she had to
> serve as my de facto advocate while I was comatose: answering my
> phone, dealing with employers and doctors and insurers and workers
> comp boards on my behalf, handling fucking Christmas alone, and
> planning for all contingencies should I live or die.
>
> I wasn’t awake for any of that. But she was, and she and my family are
> all that matter.

Mayor Pete
----------

The ebb and flow of who is currently the Democratic darling is fun to
watch. Here’s a [profile on Mayor
Pete](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/pete-buttigieg-2020-presidential-campaign.html):

> Sick of old people? He looks like Alex P. Keaton. Scared of young
> people? He looks like Alex P. Keaton. Religious? He’s a Christian.
> Atheist? He’s not weird about it. Wary of Washington? He’s from
> flyover country. Horrified by flyover country? He has degrees from
> Harvard and Oxford. Make the President Read Again? He learned
> Norwegian to read Erlend Loe. Traditional? He’s married. Woke? He’s
> gay. Way behind the rest of the country on that? He’s not too gay.
> Worried about socialism? He’s a technocratic capitalist. Worried about
> technocratic capitalists? He’s got a whole theory about how our system
> of “democratic capitalism” has to be a whole lot more “democratic.” If
> you squint hard enough to not see color, some people say, you can
> almost see Obama the inspiring professor. Oh, and he’s the son of an
> immigrant, a Navy vet, speaks seven foreign languages (in addition to
> Norwegian, Arabic, Spanish, Maltese, Dari, French, and Italian), owns
> two rescue dogs, and plays the goddamn piano. He’s actually
> terrifying. What mother wouldn’t love this guy?

Masculinity
-----------

An [introspective
story](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/magazine/cousin-kill-me-male-violence.html)about
the relationship between a man and his cousin and how it almost cost him
his life.

> As a teenager, I gravitated toward an archetype embodied by my cousin.
> I envied the power that he seemed to command and the fear he didn’t
> possess, but my effort to renounce that persona in my 20s left many
> others to face. Conventional models of male identity are everywhere
> around us. They linger in the air we breathe and infuse the culture.
> As a father and husband, I slipped into the antiquated role of
> provider, protector, patriarch — assuming the position and
> entitlements of another male archetype. What I see now is that I
> haven’t fully escaped from either. The challenge is not to believe
> that I have. It’s not to imagine that I will. It’s to watch for the
> dogmas of masculinity taking root in myself each day, to acknowledge
> whatever virtues they contain and disavow the rest. It is to seek and
> find, again and again, what does and ought to guide me.
