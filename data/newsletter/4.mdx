### Incentives

[Really interesting look](https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/) at how
OpenAI has evolved it’s AI to begin to win team battles in Dota 2. Let’s
just hope that it’s never released into the wild with the “team spirit”
hyperparameter set to 1…

> OpenAI Five does not contain an explicit communication channel between
> the heroes’ neural networks. Teamwork is controlled by a
> hyperparameter we dubbed “team spirit”. Team spirit ranges from 0 to
> 1, putting a weight on how much each of OpenAI Five’s heroes should
> care about its individual reward function versus the average of the
> team’s reward functions. We anneal its value from 0 to 1 over
> training.

### Dedication

I expect Koks to be on Chef’s Table next season. [Rebecca

on the most remote foodie destination in the world.

> Above all, there was a strange satisfaction in how hard it had been to

> the snowy hinterlands of northern Sweden, was positively metropolitan
> by comparison; it was on the European mainland, after all. At Koks, we
> were getting not just extreme cuisine but an experience that was,
> quite literally, outlandish. A bunch of foreigners had gone to absurd
> lengths to eat food that even the natives didn’t fully expect us to
> like. Looking around the table, I calculated that, collectively, we
> would be burning through roughly thirty-two thousand air miles to
> enjoy a fanatically locavore, ecologically pristine meal.

### Boundaries

### Infrastructure

Surely much easier said than done but [interesting
nonetheless](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/562472/).

> San Francisco Bay area, and parts of Michigan, shuttling people from
> here to there with minimal manual intervention. Instead of fixing the
> old trains, let’s rip out the tracks and fill the tunnels with fleets
> of autonomous vehicles running on pavement. The result would be
> radical improvements in throughput while saving money and increasing
> the ability of the system to survive a fire, flood, or terrorist
> attack.

### Hypocrisy

a very
[pertinent](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/27/17511048/mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court-anthony-kennedy-retirement)topic.

### Crisis

on why our current situation is not a breakdown in civility but a
breakdown in democracy.

> his incontinent flood of lies**. The civility police might point out
> that many conservatives hated Obama just as much, but that only
> demonstrates the limits of content-neutral analysis. The right’s
> revulsion against a black president targeted by birther conspiracy
> theories is not the same as the left’s revulsion against a racist
> president who spread birther conspiracy theories.

### Lies

Pro Publica has been busy doing really incredible work lately. Here are
Hannah Dreier's
[observations](https://www.propublica.org/article/ms-13-immigration-facts-what-trump-administration-gets-wrong)after
reporting on MS-13 for a year:

1.  MS-13 is not organizing to foil immigration ;aw

2.  MS-13 is not posing as fake families at the border

3.  MS-13 is sticking around, but It’s not growing

4.  MS-13 is preying on a specific community, not the country at large

5.  Immigration raids and deportation can only go so far

At the end of the day:

> This all matters because the gang really is terrorizing a portion of
> the population: young Latino immigrants in a few specific communities.
