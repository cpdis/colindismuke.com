A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Hong Kong

Maciej Cegłowski on [his experience in the Hong Kong
protests](https://idlewords.com/2019/08/a_walk_in_hong_kong.htm):

> All that prelude is to say, coming in to the Hong Kong protests from a
> less developed country like the United States is disorienting. If you
> have never visited one of the Zeroth World cities of Asia, like Taipei
> or Singapore, it can be hard to convey their mix of high density,
> mazelike design, utterly reliable public services, and high social
> cohesion, any more than it was possible for me or my parents to
> imagine a real American city, no matter how many movies we saw. And
> then to have to write about protests on top of it!

### Laws

Morgan Housel on the [Laws of
Investing](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-laws-of-investing/):

> What’s an investing law? There’s no definition, so I’ve taken some
> liberties here. I try to limit them to forces that influence all types
> of investments, in all sectors, in all countries, throughout all of
> history, with few exceptions, and some explanation for why it will
> continue indefinitely. A theme here is that investing is not just the
> study of finance. It’s the study of how people behave with money. So
> most of these “laws” describe a universal feature of how people
> respond to risk, reward, and scarcity. They are simple. But they are,
> I think, part of a foundation that governs most of what happens in
> investing, and will keep happening as long as investing exists.

### Brothers

The story of [Knight Oil
Tools](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/the-bitter-sibling-rivalry-at-knight-oil-tools.html):

> It was June 4, 2014, and Bryan, then 54 years old, was incredibly
> stressed out. He had just left a mediation meeting in Lafayette,
> Louisiana, with his elder brother, Mark; his younger sister, Kelley
> Sobiesk; and their team of respective lawyers. Mark and Bryan had for
> a decade been locked in a battle over control of their family company,
> Knight Oil Tools, the largest privately owned
> oil-and-gas-equipment-rental company in the world. That might not
> sound like much to boast about, but the company was worth an estimated
> \$800 million; each sibling was worth over \$100 million. The meeting,
> at which Bryan’s inheritance was at stake, had been contentious, and
> he found it supremely coincidental that, after pulling him over, the
> sheriff’s deputy almost immediately asked to search his vehicle.

The end of this saga is so depressing.

### Blink

Peter Brannen looks at [human civilization on a geological
timeline](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/arrogance-anthropocene/595795/):

> The idea that we’re in a new epoch is a profoundly optimistic one, for
> it implies that we’ll persist into the future as an industrial
> technological civilization on something like a geological timescale.
> It implies that we are at the dawning of the astrobiologist David
> Grinspoon’s “Sapiezoic Eon”—that expansive, creative, open-ended
> future in which human technology represents a new and enduring feature
> of the planet on par with the biological innovations of the Cambrian
> Explosion—rather than heading for the impending, terminal consummation
> of a major mass extinction, ending with all the conclusive destruction
> of apocalypses past.
>
> Until we prove ourselves capable of an Anthropocene worthy of the
> name, perhaps we should more humbly refer to this provisional moment
> of Earth history that we’re living through as we do the many other
> disruptive spasms in Earth history.

### Colorado
