I actually found [this interview with Dr. Tarek
Loubani](https://logicmag.io/bodies/tarek-loubani-on-3d-printing-in-gaza/),
a Palestinian-Canadian emergency room physician who founded the Glia
Project to provide affordable stethoscopes and other medical equipment
to Palestinian people, to be rather optimistic.

> The problem in Gaza is not a problem of the place being poor or the
> people being stupid. The problem is that, quite literally, the
> Israelis stop us from receiving equipment, from getting training, from
> doing anything. When I looked around, I realized that what we actually
> needed wasn’t medical devices. It was independence.

> Americans are the most hopeless people on the Israel-Palestine

> seven million years and it’s going to be there for seven million
> thousand more years.” No. It’s not. It’s collapsing. What’s really
> difficult to understand until you spend some time there is that it’s
> obvious that the occupation’s days are numbered. The occupation is
> collapsing right now, so if we were to run a project that was aimed
> solely at disaster relief — which is what some people think we should

provide the most simple, honest, and levelheaded overview of our current
economic state.

Okay who wants a plain-language explanation of the inverted yield curve?
I will do it if there's demand.
