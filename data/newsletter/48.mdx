First, an apology.

After a hiatus over the holidays, I had every intention of starting the
weekly cadence of sending y’all interesting links every Friday again.

However, just as soon as I started, I was off to Australia (*they do
have Internet here*). Not just Australia, but a
[boat](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:122.2/centery:-18.0/zoom:8)
off the northern coast with an Internet connection that would have made
the 90’s proud.

I’m back on land now and I’ve been doing a lot of reading—the world
moves on, even if you’re not fully connected to it (*imagine that*).

So, I’m sorry that this weekly has seemed more like a monthly. 🥂 To a
more consistent and interesting (*please, no*) rest of the year. 🥂

And now, a few things of note from around the Internet this week:

Logistics
---------

To quote from the article before I quote from the article: “Ingrid
Burrington [takes us on an idiosyncratic
tour](https://urbanomnibus.net/2020/01/a-tour-of-some-logistics-landscapes/)
through the entanglement of infrastructures that govern our “logistics
planet””.

> In this tour of the logistics city from its planetary to street-level
> organization, logistics values — such as efficiency, inevitability,
> and an illusion of rationality all prioritized over human and
> environmental needs — permeate the landscape. But so do interruptions
> and glitches challenging those values. These landscapes are not tidily
> interlinked so much as in a state of entanglement — sometimes
> producing chaos, sometimes producing hope, and always in defiance of
> the imperative of perpetual production. From these perspectives, the
> logistics city begins to look quite brittle.

Struggle
--------

Evan Osnos with the [definitive
longread](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/13/the-future-of-americas-contest-with-china)
on the struggle between the United States and China to dominate the 21st
century.

> Accepting censorship for profit rests on the tempting logic that
> reaching Chinese buyers with a bowdlerized portrait of the world is
> better than not reaching them at all. In fact, censored imports have
> helped acclimate Chinese citizens to a parallel reality, in which
> Freddie Mercury was not gay, and in which nobody in the N.B.A. cares
> about Hong Kong. When Chinese consumers erupt at something like Daryl
> Morey’s tweet, it indicates not a growing awareness of what the rest
> of the world thinks but a growing seclusion from it.

Osnos’ article was written before the outbreak of COVID-19. Peter Zeihan
has [an interesting take](https://zeihan.com/the-gift-of-coronavirus/)
how the virus could potentially shape China’s future.

> In a world where the Americans do the security heavy lifting and
> guarantee the world access to their consumer market – one of only a
> few that will not contract in the 2020s and 2030s – China’s global
> integration efforts aren’t simply smart, they are doomed to succeed.
> In a world in which the Americans’ step back and the rules by which
> the world works change, China is doomed to do the other thing.\
> \
> Which means coronavirus is giving us a rare gift. A glimpse into a
> future *without* globalized manufacturing in general, but in specific
> a glimpse into a world without *China*.

Power
-----

I’ve [had the pleasure of flying on a private
jet](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqKZ30nFEuv/) before, it quite
literally feels like magic. I get the backlash but I don’t think it’s
ever going away—[it’s simply to integral to the lives of the very
wealthy and
powerful](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/how-the-private-jet-became-the-singular-fetish-object-of-the-modern-billionaire).

> A private plane is alchemical, translating a nine-figure bank account
> into actual power (harder than it sometimes looks, for some people).
> “For people who are actually not that powerful except that they have a
> lot of money, it gives them a calling card to have power,” one
> private-equity mogul explains to me. “It’s all about currency. They
> get to leave when they want. They get to arrive when they want, and
> they get to make their friends be on their schedule. And then if they
> are really dicks, they can leave them when they are late.”

I can’t read [this story about Hilaree Nelson and Jim
Morrison](https://www.si.com/sports-illustrated/2020/02/06/lhotse-skiing-jim-morrison-hilaree-ne)
without tearing it up. It’s worth it.

> He wishes that, just once, “I’d taken Wyatt to school and picked him

> There is no return to normal, whatever that is. He may spend the rest

> an impermanent world. Or at least keep the past and future at bay.
> “I’m not sure if I’m back where I started,” he says, “or somewhere
> else, just going around and around.”
>
> So far, the best way forward he’s found is to strip it all down—to, as
> he says, “find calm in the suffering.” Or, as Nelson says, “I think
> the mountains are the only place for him.”

Boop Snoop
----------

Robin Sloan [created an app for only his family to
use](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/). He could sell
the app, but, as he explains, the complexity of dealing with an unknown
number of users around the globe is exponential—when you’re building for
four, things become much simpler. I hope he open sources it at some
point. If he doesn’t, [Cocoon](https://cocoon.com/), like
[Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(social_network)) (*sidenote:
it’s bad when the only link to your app is on Wikipedia*) before it, is
delightful.
