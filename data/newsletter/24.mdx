After an unplanned absence for a couple of weeks; a few things of note
from around the Internet this week:

### Detailed

An [incredible exploration and
comparison](https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps) of Apple’s new
maps.

### Opposites

I like [this
perspective](http://ifreetrade.org/article/the_secret_of_eternal_growth_the_physics_behind_pro_growth_environmentalism).
Not everything is zero-sum, sometimes everyone can win.

> In the longer term, there is nothing in physics to stop the economy

> will consist of services, though that is certainly the case, and more

> physical sectors of the economy will trend towards becoming entirely
> circular: material efficiency and recycling will improve indefinitely;
> the extraction of materials and production of pollution will first
> peak and then asymptote to zero. We will use unlimited knowledge and
> clean exergy from solar or nuclear power to drive endless improvements
> in human wellbeing and flourishing.

> they want to see preserved as this process runs its course. I hope
> they choose wisely, because, while the cost of preservation will be
> modest, the wrong decisions will be irreversible.

### Rhyme

### Control

I think we’re at the beginning of a [movement toward data
sovereignty](https://www.epsilontheory.com/control-point/) for each
individual on the Internet.

> But, my bet is that, despite the convenience of Google knowing I
> should have the bisque and saving me from the club sandwich, we are
> coming up to a shift in control points whereby the next control point
> is going to be around personal empowerment of control over personal
> data and authorization.

### Limits

From the man that brought us the Barkley Marathons: [a much, much more
devilish
race](https://deadspin.com/ultrarunner-courtney-dauwalter-takes-on-the-worlds-most-1830136537).

> “It’s not a hard trail. They can physically do it, but they lose
> belief,” Cantrell told me. “When we came up with this format, I
> thought people would run until they could stand no more, but in fact,
> people drop when they no longer believe they can win. There’s no
> reason to continue to suffer if you no longer believe you can win. If
> you don’t believe you can win, and you’re going to quit at 180 miles,
> why not quit at 160?”

### Reform

When [Michelle
Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow)
[speaks](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/opinion/sunday/criminal-justice-reforms-race-technology.html)
everyone should listen.

> Many reformers rightly point out that an ankle bracelet is preferable
> to a prison cell. Yet I find it difficult to call this progress. As I
> see it, digital prisons are to mass incarceration what Jim Crow was to
> slavery.
