A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### No Code

[Don’t make things harder than they should
be](https://medium.com/@rrhoover/the-rise-of-no-code-e733d7c0944d):

> We often perceive things that are hard to do as better. Sometimes
> that’s true. But as these “no code” tools advance, it will be silly to
> do it the old way.

### AlphaStar

[DeepMind’s rate of progress is
amazing](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/):

### Brother

[What it’s like to live as the brother of the Parkland
shooter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2019/01/25/feature/his-brother-confessed-to-gunning-down-17-people-in-parkland-but-hes-the-only-family-zach-cruz-has-left/?utm_term=.e8894836ff6c):

> Zach leaned forward. “I know you, you probably felt like you had
> nobody but I, I care about you. . . . I know I made it seem like when
> we were growing up that I hated you. . . . but truth is I just didn’t
> want to look like a — I didn’t want to look weak. I love you with all
> my heart.

### Hope

[Possibly the only redeemable character in the current administration…or
not](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/hope-hicks-west-wing-alum-begins-her-second-act):

> Perhaps the greatest indication that Hicks is, in fact, highly skilled
> at this kind of work is the way in which she has managed her own P.R.
> In a campaign and White House where nearly every person became the
> story at some point, Hicks was able to largely stay out of sight.

### Hidden

[A name you’ve probably never heard quietly helping build a
dynasty](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/1/29/18201377/matthew-slater-patriots-special-teams-coin-toss-super-bowl-liii):

> Entering Super Bowl LIII, that’s why the question of whether Slater is
> actually good at the tasks he’s supposed to perform is beside the
> point. He’s accepted the responsibility of carrying out football’s
> grimiest grunt work. Most of us are too lazy to even watch what Slater
> does from game to game. We associate him with the success of
> Belichick, Brady, and these Patriots, and—unsure of how much success
> stems from Slater’s actual talents—heap accolades upon accolades on
> him. And because Slater has received heapings upon heapings of
> accolades, he’s become the prime example of how to thrive as a
> Patriot.
