A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Books

[This rings very
true](https://popula.com/2019/03/12/on-owning-many-books/):

> I remember the thrilling convenience of buying a book online for the
> first time, and the sudden insatiable 2AM desire to have*The Collected
> Poems of Langston Hughes* or *Hiram’s Red Shirt*. Because I can! That
> feeling is separate from the responsibility of owning that book,
> separate from the act, spread out over hours, days, and weeks, of
> reading the book, separate even from the feeling of being possessed by
> one. I know this. And yet the moment when the mouse hovers over the
> purchase button contains the promise of transformation, a hope that
> obliterates the knowledge there is no more space on the shelves. It’s
> a feeling far less tidy, and far less personal, than joy.

### Olympian

[You can’t take away the hard
work](https://story.californiasunday.com/elizabeth-swaney):

> But for Swaney, the very qualities that got her into the Olympics in
> the first place — the unadulterated belief that her hard work would
> somehow pay off, her refusal to succumb to, or even acknowledge,
> self-doubt — were the very things that prevented her from being an
> athlete the public could connect with. When the online trolling began,
> Swaney responded not as someone who understood what spectators
> needed — an acknowledgment of her underachievement — but as someone
> who felt pride in what she had managed to accomplish against long
> odds.

### Different

[We need each other to
survive](https://fs.blog/2019/03/stormtrooper-problem/):

> Diversity is what makes us stronger, not weaker. Biologically, without
> diversity we die off as a species. We can no longer adapt to changes
> in the environment. This is true of social diversity as well. Without
> diversity, we have no resources to face the inevitable challenges, no
> potential for beneficial mutations or breakthroughs that may save us.

### Infamous

[On Kris Humphries many
facets](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/kris-humphries-i-never-wanted-to-be-that-guy):

> I was never a person who wanted to be famous. I’m a guy from Minnesota
> who loves the game of basketball. And yeah, 99 times out of 100, when
> people come up to me, it’s still “Bro, are you that dude?” But one out
> of 100, someone will come up to me and say something like, “Hey, all
> the bullshit aside, I watched those Nets teams, and you really played
> hard, man.” Whenever that happens, I say thank you, but deep down, I
> almost want to stop and give them a hug.

### Famous

[Continuing the Kardashian
theme](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/style/kardashians-interview.html):

> Even so, l’affaire Jordy is emblematic of a well-established
> Kardashian ecosystem: Family turmoil feeds the celebrity news cycle,
> which drives interest in the TV show, which then helps to publicize an
> ever-increasing number of sponsorships and branded products.
