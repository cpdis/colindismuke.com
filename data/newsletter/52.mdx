A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

Masks
-----

[Ryan Petersen](https://twitter.com/typesfast), Flexport’s CEO, [on why
we’re experiencing a PPE shortage in the
US](https://www.flexport.com/blog/why-there-arent-enough-masks-and-how-to-get-more/),
the most powerful, richest nation in the world.

> The current shortage of PPE is not due to a single cause. It has at
> least five components: insufficient inventory stockpiles,
> manufacturing capacity and quality control, international trade
> compliance, air uplift capacity, and working capital financing. And if
> we don't plan ahead, we'll have a sixth, involving last-mile
> distribution.

Silent
------

Richard Levitan, an emergency doctor who invented a novel imaging system
in the 90’s for teaching intubation to other doctors, [on what he saw
when he volunteered for 10 days at Bellevue
Hospital](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-testing-pneumonia.html).

> We are just beginning to recognize that Covid pneumonia initially
> causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call “silent hypoxia” —
> “silent” because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature.
>
> Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with
> fluid or pus. Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with
> breathing and other breathing problems. But when Covid pneumonia first
> strikes, patients don’t feel short of breath, even as their oxygen
> levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen
> levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays).
> Normal oxygen saturation for most persons at sea level is 94 to 100
> percent; Covid pneumonia patients I saw had oxygen saturations as low
> as 50 percent.

[Pulse oximeters](https://amzn.to/2VTaZQc) are inexpensive and instantly
show your oxygen saturation, unfortunately, they’re mostly sold out on
Amazon now 😢

Essential
---------

[Hashem Zikry describes what it’s like on the front-line fighting
COVID-19](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/27/a-new-doctor-faces-the-coronavirus-in-queens)
and how socioeconomic status plays a big part.

> “It’s become very clear to me what a socioeconomic disease this is,”
> Zikry told me. “People hear that term ‘essential workers.’ Short-order
> cooks, doormen, cleaners, deli workers—that is the patient population
> here. Other people were at home, but my patients were still working. A
> few weeks ago, when they were told to socially isolate, they still had
> to go back to an apartment with ten other people. Now they are in our
> cardiac room dying.”

Future
------

[A look into the future from
Beijing](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/life-after-covid-the-view-from-beijing.html).
Unfortunately, I think the outlook might be a lot more bleak given the
premature reopening in a lot of state.

> After a two-month lockdown that has been, in the words of one law
> professor, “astounding, unprecedented, and medieval,” the official
> number of new COVID-19 cases has diminished to almost zero.
>
> As the flowers have started to bloom, the city is starting to look as
> it does every springtime. The improvement is not sudden. Instead, it’s
> been a week-by-week process of seeing a few more restaurants and
> stores operating again, traffic and public transportation usage
> steadily grow, and folks developing the confidence to go about daily
> life.

Unequal
-------

[Alex Danco is one of my favorite
writers](https://alexdanco.com/2020/04/17/its-going-to-get-worse/).

> The next phase will be different. We’ll recognize that the COVID
> crisis is not equal-opportunity, or in fact a shared experience at
> all. Every facet of income, health, and opportunity advantage, which
> was already there before the virus, is going to get magnified
> five-fold in who gets sick and who goes broke. Our early feelings of
> common cause and cheerful solidarity are going to get seriously
> tested. As we sit and wait this out, our collective experience will
> fracture, and our frustration at the world is going to mutate into
> resentment towards each other. This is the part we’re really not
> prepared for.
>
> Post-COVID resentment is going to cut both ways: we’ll become
> resentful at those who made through better than we did, for obvious
> reasons, and we’ll also become resentful for people who have it worse
> than we do – for deeper egotistical reasons.

Farms
-----

[Maciej Cegłowski](https://idlewords.com/) talks to [J.D.
Scholten](https://www.scholten4iowa.com/), a retired baseball player
who’s running for Congress in Iowa’s 4th district, [about the rural
economy and the toll that COVID-19 is
taking](https://idlewords.com/2020/04/j.d._scholten_on_coronavirus_in_iowa.htm).

> Here in the fourth district, we’re the second most agriculture

Pair that with this [quick hit from Felix
Salmon](https://www.axios.com/local-food-farming-coronavirus-f612a060-f3ab-483c-aad3-10dcd17f308f.html)
and things look quite bleak for small farmers in America 😢 There is some
optimism though, I like this call for stronger regional supply chains:

> Only the government can [save small
> farmers](https://www.change.org/p/mayors-governors-legislators-save-america-s-restaurants?%3Fsource_location=petition_footer&algorithm=curated_trending&original_footer_petition_id=3732127&grid_position=10&pt=) in
> the short term. But in the longer term, Barber now sees a need for
> robust regional supply chains — a group of middlemen, milling and
> curing and packaging raw ingredients and selling them via local
> supermarkets to consumers. Such a chain would reduce farmers' reliance
> on restaurants to process their food.
