### Collision

[A classical math problem gets pulled into the modern
world](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-classical-math-problem-gets-pulled-into-the-modern-world-20180523/).

> Imagine a simple example: a self-driving car in a giant parking lot.
> There’s nothing in the lot except for a guard booth at the far end.
> Your goal is to program the car so that it will never drive into the
> booth.
>
> In this case, you’d start by putting a coordinate grid on the lot. Now
> make a polynomial that takes points on the grid as inputs. Make sure
> that the value of the polynomial at the location of your car is
> negative, and the value at the location of the guard booth is
> positive.
>
> At some set of points between your car and the booth, the polynomial
> will cross over from negative to positive. Since your car is allowed
> to be on points only where the polynomial is negative, these points
> form something like a wall.
>
> “If I start in a certain location, I’m not going to cross to the other
> side of the line where the obstacle is. This gives you a formal proof
> of safety for collision avoidance,” said Ahmadi.

### Numbers

There’s been a [changing of the
guard](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/how-the-math-men-overthrew-the-mad-men)
in the advertising business and it’s not for the better.

> Once, Mad Men ruled advertising. They’ve now been eclipsed by Math
> Men—the engineers and data scientists whose province is machines,
> algorithms, pureed data, and artificial intelligence.

### Transition

[Paul Stamatiou](https://paulstamatiou.com/made-on-an-ipad-pro/) on his
experience replacing his MacBook Pro with an iPad Pro.

> Against my better judgement, I decided to give tablets one more
> chance. On the last day of a vacation that [started in
> Rwanda](https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/966383134722883587) and
> ended in the UK, I walked into the Regent Street Apple Store in London
> and purchased a 12.9" iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard.
>
> That was a few months ago. A few months in which my 13" MacBook Pro
> has not even been powered up once. Any new gadget novelty has long
> since worn off and I’m still loving and using this iPad Pro daily.

### Inequality

It’s more clear every day: [the rich get
richer](https://evonomics.com/capitals-share-of-income-is-way-higher-than-you-think/),
while the poor get poorer.

> People get income for doing stuff, and they get income for owning
> stuff. Increasingly the latter. And the ownership share of income goes
> to a small slice of households that [own almost all the
> stuff](http://www.demos.org/blog/9/5/14/top-10-white-families-own-almost-everything).

### Future Work

[Automation will make lifelong learning a necessary part of
work](https://hbr.org/2018/05/automation-will-make-lifelong-learning-a-necessary-part-of-work).

> With the advent of AI, basic cognitive skills, such as reading and
> basic numeracy, will not suffice for many jobs, while demand for
> advanced technological skills, such as coding and programming, will
> rise, by 55% in 2030, according to our analysis.
>
> The need for social and emotional skills including initiative taking
> and leadership will also rise sharply, by 24%, and among higher
> cognitive skills, creativity and complex information and problem
> solving will also become significantly more important. These are often
> seen as “soft” skills that schools and education systems in general
> are not set up to impart. Yet in a more automated future, when
> machines are capable of taking on many more rote tasks, these skills
> will become increasingly important — precisely because machines are
> still far from able to provide expertise and coaching, or manage
> complex relationships.

I read this twice and nearly spit out the water in my mouth both times.
From [Axios
Future](https://www.axios.com/china-jd-warehouse-jobs-4-employees-shanghai-d19f5cf1-f35b-4024-8783-2ba79a573405.html):

> [JD.com](http://JD.com), a Chinese e-commerce gargantuan, has built a
> big new Shanghai fulfillment center that can organize, pack and ship
> 200,000 orders a day. It employs four people — all of whom service the
> robots.
