A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Listen

[Nothing to see
here](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2169474/canada-installs-chinese-underwater-monitoring-devices-next-us)
🤷🏼‍♂️

> While the ONC confirmed it had sited the Chinese devices within its
> network, it declined to provide any information about them or say how
> they might be used. The Chinese institute was equally reticent, and
> while the Canadian foreign ministry acknowledged the receipt of a
> request for comment it did not immediately reply. The US state
> department said it had “nothing to say” on the matter.

### Reality

[delivering a dose of economic
wisdom](https://thereformedbroker.com/2018/10/23/and-now-a-reality-check/)
a few days before the midterms.

> The constant lying has been a boon to the President, during his
> campaign and pretty much throughout his entire life. Supporters of his
> policies see it as a means to an end, so they’re certainly not going
> to turn on him. He promised to run the country for the benefit of the
> one third of America that loves what he’s doing and he keeps that
> promise every day. There’s never been a betrayal or a compromise or an
> apology for anything, they feel that they are getting exactly what he
> said he would give them – if not now, then soon enough.
>
> In the meantime, the bloodless verdict of the market is beginning to
> call bullsh\*t on his economic claims. The economic expansion is good,
> not great, and starting to slow down thanks to the rising cost of
> money (spurred on by tax cut stimulus) and the cyclical slowdown
> around the world. It turns out that tariffs are an impediment to
> everyone’s economy, not just Mexico’s, China’s or the European
> Union’s.

If you want to feel warm and fuzzy about social media (an increasingly
difficult proposition) then don’t follow Jonathan Albright.

I've gotten several questions from journalists today re: "are platforms
doing better combatting propaganda & disinformation?" I said maybe. Then
I pulled another you-know-who mention network (graph) from Instagram.
It's not just bad, it's \#offthechain

### Capital

[This
essay](http://criticallegalthinking.com/2018/10/25/trump-or-capital-in-the-oval-office/)
is a little difficult to get through but it’s worth the effort.

> For Trump is in love with chaos and seeks union with it. His most
> bizarre announcements express perhaps the innermost truth: Trump has
> given himself to absurdity, has so deranged matters that the POTUS has
> willingly become Nebuchadnezzar, crawling on all fours but, unlike the
> accursed Babylonian, this status has taken on a form of inverted
> beatitude whereby god, blinded with rage by the darkness stares for
> eternity into the whirlwind. A god’s highest expression at its lowest
> level.

### Real

A [powerful and raw
essay](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/what-the-hell-happened-to-darius-miles)
from former NBA player [Darius
Miles](https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/27de3b87-2taps.gif?width=1000).

> When you pop out the womb in East St. Louis, it’s guns, drugs and
> danger, from start to finish. And I’m not saying that to brag or
> nothing. It’s just what it is. It’s the murder capital. And the thing
> about it is that it’s only 89 blocks.
>
> So no matter who you are, or how much you try to keep your head down …
> there’s nowhere to hide. You’re in it. There’s no choice. Fact of the
> matter is, I had a lot of cousins who were street pharmacists. A lot
> of my people were Streets Disciples. It was what it was. You heard
> gunshots every night. Routine. You don’t know any different. But
> that’s the thing ― you might read about those kinds of places, or see
> them on TV. I don’t think the average person reading this in Montana
> or whatever understands what it’s like to be a kid in that
> environment.
>
> You don’t have any dreams. You’re just thinking about survival.

### Paradox

[This is rather
depressing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-in-the-machine/201808/the-dunning-kruger-effect-may-help-explain-trumps-support)
and, unfortunately, affects us all (some more than others).

> As predicted, the results showed that those who scored low on
> political knowledge were also the ones who overestimated their level
> of knowledge. But that wasn’t all. When participants were given cues
> that made them engage in partisan thought, the Dunning-Kruger effect
> was made even stronger. This occurred with both Republicans and
> Democrats, but only in those who scored low on political knowledge to
> begin with.
>
> These findings are fascinating but equally troubling. How do you
> combat ignorance when the ignorant believe themselves to be
> knowledgeable? Even worse, how do you fight it when America is
> becoming increasingly polarized, which certainly increases the
> salience of partisan identities?
