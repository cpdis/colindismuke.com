A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

Rights
------

[People don’t have rights, guns
do](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/09/05/the-rights-of-guns/).

> If a person were found to have shown up regularly in so many places
> where so many crimes had been committed by so many people, how could
> that person not be called to account for such suspicious behavior? He
> would clearly be investigated for being present with such persistence
> at crime scenes. Did he facilitate them, making them easier by his
> mere presence? What could induce any innocent person to be so
> energetically omnipresent at so many varied crime scenes? What excuse
> could relieve him from the charge of being an accessory? A person with
> such skill and dogged effort would be considered a national menace, no
> matter how many excuses he could concoct for such weird conduct.
>
> But guns can do all of those things and profess an entire
> non-involvement. “Who, me?” says Gun, going on:

> > I never asked to be part of anyone’s wrongdoing. Why pick on me? You
> > must have a gun-persecution disorder. You accusers are the ones who
> > show up at every crime scene, trying to drag me into actions as if
> > I’m an agent. I am totally passive. I never asked to be bought by a
> > homicidal maniac. Go after the nutty people and leave me alone.
>
> So also argues the attorney for the defense, the NRA.

Culture War
-----------

On [raising children in the modern
age](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/when-the-culture-war-comes-for-the-kids/596668/):

> In his new book, *The Meritocracy Trap*, the Yale Law
> professor [Daniel Markovits argues that this system turns elite
> families into business
> enterprises](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/meritocracys-miserable-winners/594760/),
> and children into overworked, inauthentic success machines, while
> producing an economy that favors the super-educated and blights the
> prospects of the middle class, which sinks toward the languishing
> poor. Markovits describes the immense investments in money and time
> that well-off couples make in their children. By kindergarten, the
> children of elite professionals are already a full two years ahead of
> middle-class children, and the achievement gap is almost unbridgeable.

and

> I can imagine the retort—the rebuke to everything I’ve written here:
> Your privilege has spared them. There’s no answer to that—which is why
> it’s a potent weapon—except to say that identity alone should neither
> uphold nor invalidate an idea, or we’ve lost the Enlightenment to pure
> tribalism. Adults who draft young children into their cause might
> think they’re empowering them and shaping them into virtuous people (a
> friend calls the Instagram photos parents post of their woke kids
> “selflessies”). In reality the adults are making themselves feel more
> righteous, indulging another form of narcissistic pride, expiating
> their guilt, and shifting the load of their own anxious battles onto
> children who can’t carry the burden, because they lack the
> intellectual apparatus and political power. Our goal shouldn’t be to
> tell children what to think. The point is to teach them how to think
> so they can grow up to find their own answers.

Charge More
-----------

A good primer on [Vickrey
auctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction) and [selling
mechanical keyboard kits for
\$1,668](https://kevinlynagh.com/notes/pricing-niche-products/).

> I knew nerds built their own mechanical keyboards, but I hadn’t
> realized just how deep this obsessive-collector subculture went.
>
> During my visit, my friend listed their kits for sale and sold out
> their entire inventory of 60 kits *literally* within minutes.
>
> So I did what any good friend would do: Point out that \$500 is
> obviously below the market-clearing price and they should charge more
> next time.
>
> But exactly how much more?

Burning
-------

Quinn Norton [on the infrastructural “technical debt” we’ve accrued over
the last few hundreds
years](https://www.emptywheel.net/2019/10/18/a-world-we-built-to-burn/),
how the climate crisis and ecosystem collapse are making things worse,
and on the importance of having a plan “at every level from
transnational to individual.” It’s a very good down to earth perspective
on the current situation of most countries and probably a good posture
to take towards infrastructure, the planet, and the work to be done.

> This is a story of climate change, but it’s also a story of messed-up
> political priorities that date to when our great-grandparents were
> still getting used to the idea of electricity. It’s a story of
> disrespect and exploitation of the land, of failures in capitalism,
> regulation, and political will, of people who don’t want to live with
> the consequences of their decisions, and people who have to live with
> the consequences of other people’s decisions.

Backstory
---------

Behind every great AI is a [hand written system built in the
1960’s](https://vicki.substack.com/p/neural-nets-are-just-people-all-the).

> So, if you’re doing image recognition in 2019, it’s highly likely
> you’re using an image recognition system built by images tagged by
> people using Mechanical Turk in 2007 that sit on top of language
> classification systems built by graduate students prowling newspaper
> clippings in the 1960s.
>
> Simply put, every single piece of decision-making in a high-tech
> neural network initially rests on a human being manually putting
> something together and making a choice.

Water
-----

Ben Hunt on how executives use
[financialization](https://www.epsilontheory.com/this-is-water/)to
[enrich themselves and widen the inequality
gap](https://www.epsilontheory.com/yeah-its-still-water/).

> One day we will recognize the defining Zeitgeist of the Obama/Trump
> years for what it is: an unparalleled transfer of wealth to the
> managerial class.
>
> It’s the triumph of the manager over the steward. The triumph of the
> manager over the entrepreneur. The triumph of the manager over the
> founder. The triumph of the manager over ALL.

Facebook
--------

You don’t need to read more than the [first two
paragraphs](https://engineering.fb.com/data-infrastructure/scribe/),
that’s just a ridiculous amount of data.

> Scribe processes logs with an input rate that can exceed 2.5 terabytes
> per second and an output rate that can exceed 7 terabytes per second.
> To put this workload into perspective, the output of the Large Hadron
> Collider at CERN during its latest run was estimated to reach only 25
> gigabytes per second.
