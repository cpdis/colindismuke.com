A few things of note from around the Internet this week…

## Deranged

The [story
behind](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/lane-davis-ralph-retort-seattle4truth-alt-right)
the unraveling of Lane Davis, alt-right troll. The part about the
content creators not realizing that people take them seriously was
enlightening.

> I went to try to find some answers about Lane. I discovered that his
> life leading up to the killing — isolated, dependent, resentful, and
> ruled by the perverse incentives of internet content production — has
> much to tell us about the kind of man for whom the new fringes of
> American life are most dangerous. In his room, online, as a combatant
> in an endless culture war, Lane found what had eluded him everywhere
> else in life: a sense of purpose. And then something happened that
> threatened to take it all away.

## Generosity

Susan Unterberg [anonymously
gave](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/arts/design/susan-unterberg-artist-grant.html)
a \$25,000 gift each year for the past 22 years.

> The gift is part of a grant program that has paid out a total of \$5.5
> million over the last 22 years to support underrecognized female
> artists over age 40. It is called Anonymous Was a Woman, in reference
> to a line in Virginia Woolf’s “A Room of One’s Own,” to pay tribute to
> female artists in history who signed their paintings “Anonymous” so
> that their work would be taken seriously.

## Learning

An [interesting
post](https://janav.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/my-mind-wanderings-on-learning-and-thinking.pdf)
on learning and thinking from Jana Vembunarayanan.

> Learning is hard. Your brain takes time to consolidate different
> pieces into one chunk to form a cohesive whole. Do you remember how
> much time you took learning to ride a bike? You need to have the
> courage, patience, perseverance, curiosity, reflection, and rest to
> allow the brain to learn, form chunks, and to rewire. Do not compare
> yourself with others. It will create anxiety and lead to frustration.
> You are different from others. Learn at your own pace.

## Unclear

Doug Clark cuts through a lot of the noise with regard to Otto Warmbier
and tries to [piece together the actual
story](https://www.gq.com/story/otto-warmbier-north-korea-american-hostage-true-story),
not the common narrative.

> From that point on, the White House no longer focused on Otto's
> tragedy. In fact, it swung so far in the opposite direction that
> civil-rights groups complained about human-rights issues not being on
> the agenda for the summit in Singapore. When the three remaining
> American detainees were released in May, Trump welcomed them home by
> saying, “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to
> these three incredible people.”
>
> The story of Otto being brutally beaten had outlived its usefulness.

### Oven

The great migration out of India as it [becomes
uninhabitable](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/climate/india-heat-wave-summer.html)
is going to be a geopolitical nightmare. Syria on a monstrous scale.

> “These cities are going to become unlivable unless urban governments
> put in systems of dealing with this phenomenon and make people aware,”
> said Sujata Saunik, who served as a senior official in the Indian
> Ministry of Home Affairs and is now a fellow at the Harvard University
> School of Public Health. “It’s a major public health challenge.”
