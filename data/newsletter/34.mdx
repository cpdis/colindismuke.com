A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Happy

[Ben Carlson on our current emotional
conundrum](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/04/why-well-never-all-be-happy-again/):

> My strategy for trying to avoid being brought down by the sheer amount
> of negativity these days looks like this:

-   Avoid 24/7 cable news at all costs. It’s been years since I’ve sat
    down and watched this stuff on purpose.

-   Avoid Facebook like the plague. Instagram is a much more joyful
    place (although I guess Twitter is my hedge here).

-   Get the negative people out of my life. Not as easy as it sounds but
    that is the goal as I age.

### Higher Education

[Rusty Guinn on the myth of American post-secondary
education](https://www.epsilontheory.com/starry-eyes-and-starry-skies):

> And yes, Virginia, the importance of post-secondary education in
> America IS a myth – one of our most powerful. No, that doesn’t mean
> that college and its attendant experience don’t hold intrinsic value.
> It also doesn’t mean that the credential offered by these institutions
> isn’t a real currency. It means that the Common Knowledge underlying
> that currency is far more powerful than whatever the truth about
> college is. It means that the stories we tell about college are more
> important in almost every way than the facts. It means that whenever
> we talk about college in America, we are nearly always talking about
> the meme of college!

### Frontier

Twitter is far and away my most important online social network. I
attribute an inordinate amount of entertainment and knowledge to the
people I follow and have interacted with over the past 12 years.
However, as I read [this
article](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/jack-dorseys-ted-interview-and-the-end-of-an-era)
it seems like there's a relatively simple, yet impossible
solution—Twitter, Facebook, et. al should just go away. To quote [the
article](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/jack-dorseys-ted-interview-and-the-end-of-an-era),
"it has grown increasingly clear that allowing young, mostly male
technologists to build largely unregulated, proprietary, international
networks might have been a large-scale, high-stakes error in judgment."

> That Dorsey is now expected to find a solution to unprecedented and
> unforeseen problems, on a platform designed thirteen years ago for
> narrow and relatively innocent use cases, seems darkly comical at
> best—an instance of refusing to learn from our mistakes. “He’s dealing
> with a scale of a problem that doesn’t have a lot of precedent in
> human history,” a programmer friend of mine texted. “It’s actually
> kind of scary that he comes across as so unstudied. I think
> ‘conversational health’ is a dodge. Twitter, and Jack, want to avoid
> taking positions on who is doing harm. But they don’t have that luxury
> at this point, because Twitter is such a megaphone.”

### Regulation

[Scott Alexander on medicine shortages in the United
States](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/04/30/buspirone-shortage-in-healthcaristan-ssr/):

> You get more of what you subsidize and less of what you tax.
> Unfortunately, the FDA is inadvertently taxing companies for being in
> the generic drug business. And it’s taxing them more if they’re not a
> monopolist with economies of scale. That means we get fewer companies
> in the generics industry, and more monopolists.
>
> So my very tentative guess as to why buspirone is more plagued by
> shortages than bread or chairs is because number one, the need for FDA
> approval makes it hard for new companies to enter the buspirone
> industry, and number two, the FDA’s fee structure favors large-scale
> monopolies over small-scale competitors.

### Catastrophe

[Ben Wittes on Bill
Barr](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/bill-barrs-performance-was-catastrophic/588574/):

> Barr has now acted, and we can now evaluate his actual, rather than
> his hypothesized, performance. It has been catastrophic. Not in my
> memory has a sitting attorney general more diminished the credibility
> of his department on any subject. It is a kind of trope of political
> opposition in every administration that the attorney general—whoever
> he or she is—is politicizing the Justice Department and acting as a
> defense lawyer for the president. In this case it is true.
