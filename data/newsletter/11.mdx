A few things from around the Internet this week…

### Wide

Sobering
[exploration](http://www.epsilontheory.com/things-fall-apart-pt-1/) of
our current situation from Ben Hunt.

Scapegoat

This one
[post](http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2018/08/09/the-scapegoat/)
explains so much about the economy, inequality, markets, pensions, the
retirement crisis and what to expect in the future.

> We have plenty of economic problems in this country, but buybacks are
> not the reason for our problems and eliminating them is not the
> answer.
>
> I am not on a crusade against capitalism. The alternatives, socialism
> or communism have proved time and again to be a failure. Capitalism is
> a big reason why the United States is the most powerful country in the
> world, and why I can order a car to pick me up on my handheld
> computer. I consider myself very fortunate to have been born here, and
> there is no place I would rather live and raise my children. However,
> I do think we are going down a dangerous path.

> The quality of life in the 21st century is light years beyond what
> people experienced in the 19th century, but people compare themselves
> with their neighbors, not with their ancestors.

### Rigged

It’s funny to have lived through the time period [this took place
in](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-an-ex-cop-rigged-mcdonalds-monopoly-game-and-stole-millions)
and be completely unaware that it ever happened.

### Space

Great

of Mark Stucky, the lead test pilot for Virgin Galactic, in the New
Yorker:

> “I don’t know where to start,” Stucky said. “Some of us have been
> waiting years to do that again!” Not only had they resumed launching
> manned rockets; they were flying them. And, for the first time, Virgin
> Galactic had done it all on its own: with its pilots, its rocket
> motor, its spaceship. “Richard has been waiting longer than all of
> us,” Stucky said. “Hopefully, we gave him a good flight.”
