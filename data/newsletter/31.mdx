### HAL 9000

The [most levelheaded and coherent
summary](http://approximatelycorrect.com/2019/02/17/openai-trains-language-model-mass-hysteria-ensues/)of
[OpenAI's recent NLP
advancements](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/). Turns
out, the robots are not taking over the world quite yet.

> Then the entire world lost its mind. If you follow machine learning,
> then for a brief period of time, OpenAI’s slightly bigger, slightly
> more coherent language model may have overtaken Trump’s fictitious
> state of emergency as the biggest story on your newsfeed.

### Words

Dictionaries used to be a lot more fun to read and a lot more useful to
the writing process because of it. James Somers [goes into
detail](http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary) about what we’re missing.

> Webster’s dictionary took him 26 years to finish. It ended up having
> 70,000 words. He wrote it all himself, including the etymologies,
> which required that he learn 28 languages, including Old English,
> Gothic, German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Welsh, Russian,
> Aramaic, Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit. He was plagued by debt to fund
> the project; he had to mortgage his home.

### Decades

The
[story](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-famous-photo-of-chernobyls-most-dangerous-radioactive-material-was-a-selfie)of
why a man is standing next to one of the most dangerous artifacts in the
world and why he keeps returning to it.

> In the days and weeks after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in late
> April 1986, simply being in the same room as this particular pile of
> radioactive material—known as the Elephant’s Foot—would have killed
> you within a couple of minutes. Even a decade later, when this image
> was taken, the radiation probably caused the film to develop
> strangely, creating the photo’s grainy quality. The man in this photo,
> Artur Korneyev, has likely visited this area more than anyone else,
> and in doing so has been exposed to more radiation than almost anyone
> in history.

### Surveillance

I think [this
article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook)
is a bit breathless but still brings up interesting questions to ponder
about the effects of modern technology on society and our lives.

> Larry Page grasped that human experience could be Google’s virgin
> wood, that it could be extracted at no extra cost online and at very
> low cost out in the real world. For today’s owners of surveillance
> capital the experiential realities of bodies, thoughts and feelings
> are as virgin and blameless as nature’s once-plentiful meadows,
> rivers, oceans and forests before they fell to the market dynamic. We
> have no formal control over these processes because we are not
> essential to the new market action. Instead we are exiles from our own
> behaviour, denied access to or control over knowledge derived from its
> dispossession by others for others. Knowledge, authority and power
> rest with surveillance capital, for which we are merely “human natural
> resources”. We are the native peoples now whose claims to
> self-determination have vanished from the maps of our own experience.

### Disruption

Thinking about the Facebook content moderator hells and the Theranos
mechanical-turk-ing of blood sample processing. Strange how all these
"disruptions" turn out to just be exploitation of labor.

### Detail

The level of detail in this post rivals the Stephen Wolfram’s reigning
champion, his [post on his personal
analytics](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/)
from six years ago. I think this new one, [on his personal
infrastructure](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/),
wins.

> Of course, a critical piece of making my metasearcher work is that
> I’ve stored so much stuff. For example, I actually have all the
> 815,000 or so emails that I’ve written in the past 30 years, and all
> the 2.3 million (mostly non-spam) ones I’ve received. And, yes, it
> helps tremendously that I’ve had a company with organized IT
> infrastructure etc. for the past 32 years.
>
> But email, of course, has the nice feature that it’s “born digital”.
> What about things that were, for example, originally on paper? Well, I
> have been something of an “informational packrat” for most of my life.
> And in fact I’ve been pretty consistently keeping documents back to
> when I started elementary school in 1968.
