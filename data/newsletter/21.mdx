A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Obsolete

From my perspective, [Jupyter is everywhere and Mathematica is almost
nowhere](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)
🤷🏼‍♂️

> Which, who knows, might well be true—maybe computational notebooks
> will only take root if they’re backed by a single super-language, or
> by a company with deep pockets and a vested interest in making them
> work. But it seems just as likely that the opposite is true. A
> federated effort, while more chaotic, might also be more robust—and
> the only way to win the trust of the scientific community. Wolfram has
> a hard time seeing outside Wolfram, and perhaps that’s the reason that
> the Mathematica notebook has remained relatively obscure while a rival
> system—derivative, yes, and simplistic, but open—looks to be taking
> over the world.

### Hard

Making the world better is hard and it takes work. Barry Yeoman [details
what’s needed to build a more equitable
city](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/10/searching-soul-community/572986).

> If Durham’s history is proof of anything, it stands for the idea that
> building community is an all-hands effort that requires buy-in from
> everybody—elected officials, civic organizations, religious leaders,
> artists, and businesses. And it can only be built by lowering
> barriers—to owning a home, to exhibiting your paintings, to launching
> a startup, to gaining a voice in public policy, to feeling like you
> belong in the town square.

### Bye

Steven Levy [goes way behind the scenes at Blue
Origin](https://www.wired.com/story/jeff-bezos-blue-origin).

> Bezos buys none of this. He sees humanity’s move to space as the only
> option. He sees it with the certainty of mathematics. So we might as
> well get started, long before we exceed the energy resources available
> to us and face catastrophe. “I’m just building the infrastructure so
> it’ll be there when people realize they need it,” he says. How will we
> know it’s time to blast off—will it be in one generation, or 10? “It
> will become incredibly obvious,” he says.

### Beginnings

Nick Paumgarten with a [great, in-depth, early history of
Ethereum](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/22/the-prophets-of-cryptocurrency-survey-the-boom-and-bust).

> Now and then, legacy titans voiced their scorn. Jamie Dimon, the chief
> executive of J. P. Morgan, labelled crypto “a fraud”; Warren Buffett
> used the phrase “rat poison squared.” Legions of skeptics and
> technophobes, out of envy, ignorance, or wisdom, savored such
> pronouncements, while the true believers and the vertiginously
> invested mostly brushed it aside. They had faith that a new order was
> nigh. They pumped but did not dump.
