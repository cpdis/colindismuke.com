A few things of note from around the Internet this week…

### Incredible Flying Robot

[Incredibly insightful and easy to understand
podcas](https://overcast.fm/+LENURB5T0)t with [Dr. Ashish
Kapoor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/akapoor/) from
Microsoft Research. He described AI and autonomous vehicles in a way
that I had never considered before.

### Black Mirror

[Dystopia is a lot closer than we
think.](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278)

> It’s probably the largest social engineering project ever attempted, a
> way to control and coerce more than a billion people. If successful,
> it will be the world’s first digital dictatorship.

### 10 Years Later

It’s really remarkable [how many people were affected during the
financial
crisis](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/subprime-mortgage-crisis/) and
the reverberations that are still rocking people’s worlds.

> “The latest iteration of the American dream might not be about owning
> a house at all. It might just be about financial stability. “To some
> extent, if you’ve got the financial security to buy a house and take
> on those financial commitments, that means in some sense that you have
> made it,” the University of Florida’s Mark Flannery said. “It’s not
> the house that means you’ve made it. It’s your ability to finance the
> house that means you’ve made it and you’ve attained part of the
> American dream.”

### Invaluable

[Listen to Pastor Chris Seay consider what a life is
worth](https://ecclesiahouston.org/liturgy/2018/9/16/invaluable) and
then watch the video below. Truly incredible. If you’re reading this,
you’re important and you matter, never forget that.

Remarkable

It’s **remarkable**that a likely future Supreme Court justice can barely
contain (read: couldn’t contain) his extremely partisan outrage. It’s
**remarkable**that a significant number of people still can’t understand
the trauma of sexual assault and why a woman wouldn’t immediately come
forward or tell someone. It’s **remarkable**to me that self-professed
patriots always, without fail choose party over country. It’s
**remarkable**to me that there was just as much, if not more, sympathy
for Brett Kavanaugh from the Republican side of the dais as there was
for Dr. Ford. It’s **unremarkable**to me that as the powerful incumbents
are challenged by a new order, that they try to tear the whole system
down around them. [Brett Kavanaugh is exactly who he was expected to
be](https://www.thecut.com/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearing-republicans-ford-testimony-trump.html).

> The lesson of the United States in this moment is that misogyny and
> racism aren’t disqualifiers. They are the qualities the right wing
> considers key to their larger project — perhaps, in fact, main selling
> points.
