A few things from around the Internet this week…

### Tragic

I can’t imagine Schlitterbahn going away but [this
story](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/jeff-henry-verruckt-schlitterbahns-tragic-slide/)
paints a pretty grim picture.

> It was a Sunday afternoon, August 7, 2016, the temperature a pleasant
> 78 degrees, as ten-year-old Caleb Schwab began the 264-step climb to
> the top of Verrückt, the world’s tallest waterslide, which loomed like
> a colossus over the forty-acre Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City.
> Caleb was a brown-eyed boy, his nose dotted with freckles. He had come
> to the park with his father, Scott, a state legislator; his mother,
> Michele; and his three brothers. That day, Schlitterbahn was offering
> free admission to Kansas elected officials and their families, along
> with a buffet lunch, and the Schwabs, who lived in the town of Olathe,
> southwest of Kansas City, were thrilled. A free day at Schlitterbahn.
> What could be better?

### Crushing

A sexual harassment [horror
story](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/hsbc-sexual-harassment-hr/)
at HSBC from David Dayer at Highline.

> This tradition of silence and futility helps explain why, for all of
> the training seminars and employee tiplines and initiatives to promote
> women, banking hasn’t experienced the reckoning that other
> professional fields have. “Wall Street has had absolutely no reform,”
> says Nancy Erika Smith, whose sexual harassment cases include clients
> from the banking industry. “It’s a macho frat boy culture to this day.

### Parenthood

[Ben
Carlson](http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2018/07/10-money-revelations-from-being-a-parent/):

> Life is not static so neither are your responsibilities, priorities,
> spending habits, savings goals, or risk profile. I’m sure the finances
> of having kids will change as they get older and I learn and adapt. I
> just have to remind myself that life is all about balance — spending
> vs. saving, enjoying the moment vs. delaying gratification, time spent
> working vs. time spent with family, and things we need vs. things we
> want.
>
> These competing ideas are never in equilibrium but that’s the goal.

### Ecosystem

[I](https://medium.com/s/story/it-was-raining-in-the-data-center-9e1525c37cc3)’ve
always been interested in the locales chosen to house data centers.
Everest Pipkin [takes a
look](https://medium.com/s/story/it-was-raining-in-the-data-center-9e1525c37cc3)
at these key pieces of Internet infrastructure.

> The immensity and environmental costliness of server farms are
> undeniably bad optics, especially for an industry so committed to a
> vision of self that rests in futurity, promoting a high-tech potential
> that has nothing to do with the industrial revolution (and all of the
> pollution and disaffective labor of that era). Instead, the rhetoric
> of the internet, and especially storage on the internet, is that of a
> light, ephemeral place that requires neither work nor coal nor
> landscape to hold itself up. It is supposed to be a cloud.

### Hello 🤖

[Another](https://blog.openai.com/learning-dexterity/) crazy experiment
and result at OpenAI.

> Although the first humanoid hands were developed decades ago, using
> them to manipulate objects effectively has been a long-standing
> challenge in robotic control. Unlike other problems such as
> locomotion, progress on dextrous manipulation using traditional
> robotics approaches has been slow, and current techniques remain
> limited in their ability to manipulate objects in the real world.

⚾

> We know what every person is doing on the field at all times. We know
> what the bat and the ball are doing on the field at all times. We now
> have information we didn’t dream we’d have a few years back.
> Developing models from all that information is going to be critical to
> the success of teams going forward. They can gain an edge—and an edge
> in terms of not only being first to use that technology but being able
> to implement it more quickly than the other teams. Because any edge we
> get, we know it’s just a matter of time before the other clubs catch
> up.
