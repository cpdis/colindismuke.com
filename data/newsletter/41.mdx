A few visualizations (best viewed on a big screen) of note from around
the Internet this week:

[Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/about-us/)
----------------------------------------------------------------

A collaboration between Oceana, an international ocean conservation
organisation; SkyTruth, experts in using satellite technology to protect
the environment; and Google, who provide the tools for processing all of
the data. Fishing activity from all over the world is shown in realtime.

[U.S. Gun Deaths](https://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2013)
---------------------------------------------------------

Near realtime, crowdsourced data of 2013 gun deaths.

[A World of Terror](https://terror.periscopic.com/)
---------------------------------------------------

Terror attacks from 1970-2013.

[The Next to Die](https://www.themarshallproject.org/next-to-die)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Marshall Project, in collaboration with many publications around the
US, keeps track of death row inmates and shows who will be the next to
die.

[Beautiful News Daily](https://informationisbeautiful.net/beautifulnews/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, in contrast to most of the visualizations above, a daily
compilation of unseen trends and uplifting statistics about the world we
live in.

From [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/):

> Weâ€™ll be releasing a chart every day for a year to move our attention
> beyond dramatic news headlines to the slow developments and quiet
> trends that go unseen, uncelebrated. Amazing things are happening in
> the world, thanks to human ingenuity, endeavour and collaboration.
