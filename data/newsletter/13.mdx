A few things of note from around the Internet this week…

### Power

Initially, the game that activist investors play is impressive. But,
spend any amount of time investigating and they’re overwhelmingly just a
bunch of greedy, white men (seriously, [Google Paul
Singer](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&q=Paul+Singer&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCrIzi2qVEJia0llJ1vpF6TmF-SkAqmi4vw8q-LMlNTyxMpiAKqH0-82AAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4qPKVq5bdAhUjxFQKHWIlBuUQzTooATAdegQIDBBA&biw=911&bih=1343&dpr=1)
and check out that lineup) that are obsessed with power.

> Throughout our conversations, Bush returned to a theme that consumed
> him. He talked about how investors like Singer—financiers who take the
> assets built by others and manipulate them like puzzle pieces to make
> money for themselves—are affecting the country on a grand scale. A
> healthy country, he said, needs economic biodiversity, with companies
> of different sizes chasing innovation, or embarking on long, hard
> projects, without being punished. The disproportionate power of the
> Wall Street investor class, Bush felt, dampened all that, and
> gradually made the economy, and most of the people in it, more
> fragile.

### Harvey

Bryan Washington [looks

at Hurricane Harvey:

> More than a few essayists and pundits broached the question of why
> Houstonians didn’t prepare for a storm, but the question answers
> itself: We did. The city rallied for a coming storm, not the storm
> that came. The city’s recent history with flooding ranged from the
> pedestrian to the catastrophic, but a Harvey hadn’t happened before.
> And had there actually been an evacuation, considering that some areas
> saw nearly ten inches of rain in under two hours, we’d have created
> six killing lanes across multiple highways and feeder roads. There was
> simply no way of “preparing” for it—unless, of course, we’d all heeded
> the scientists and meteorologists and journalists ruing global
> warming’s effect on our Gulf for years.

### Future

Stephen Curry [doing his

to make the world a little bit better for our twin girls and all little
girls growing up today.

> I want our girls to grow up knowing that there are no boundaries that
> can be placed on their futures, period. I want them to grow up in a
> world where their gender does not feel like a rulebook for what they
> should think, or be, or do. And I want them to grow up believing that
> they can dream big, and strive for careers where they’ll be treated
> fairly.

### Rage

[Another
chapter](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/08/debt-student-loan-forgiveness-betsy-devos-education-department-fedloan)
in the incredibly length book about the broken American education
system.

> Rohit Chopra, a former Education Department special adviser, put it to
> me this way: “The most important thing to remember” about the federal
> student loan program, he said, “is borrowers are not the customer.
> Borrowers are the product.”
