A few things of note from around the Internet this week…

### No

There are striking similarities between Facebook and global financial
system before the crash (Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy 10 years
ago this week). Both are incredibly complex systems that have
connections and repercussions that no one (literally, no one) can
imagine, understand, or control. It’s hard for me to imagine exactly
what a Great Social Crash will look like but it seems like it’s on the
horizon. [Evan Osnos
on](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy)
whether Mark Zuckerberg can fix Facebook before it breaks democracy:

> Facebook engineers became a new breed of behaviorists, tweaking levers
> of vanity and passion and susceptibility. The real-world effects were
> striking. In 2012, when Chan was in medical school, she and Zuckerberg
> discussed a critical shortage of organs for transplant, inspiring
> Zuckerberg to add a small, powerful nudge on Facebook: if people
> indicated that they were organ donors, it triggered a notification to
> friends, and, in turn, a cascade of social pressure. Researchers later
> found that, on the first day the feature appeared, it increased
> official organ-donor enrollment more than twentyfold nationwide.

### Magic

On the one hand, buying a Christmas tree is time-honored tradition for a
lot of families. On the other hand, how can one resist the [magic of

at your door without strapping it on top of or stuffing it your car? I
[have a

that Tim O’Connor isn’t going to be feeling quite as smug in the near
future.

> the 27 million real Christmas trees purchased last year were bought
> online, mostly from grower’s own sites. “It’s so small, it’s almost
> undetectable,” O’Connor said.

### Perpetual

Nothing changes. A few may lose their wealth, status, or power but the
vast majority of the “Master’s of the Universe” will continue along as
if nothing had ever happened; it’s human nature. A [unique look at the

of the Four Seasons restaurant in New York.

### Proposal for a book to be adapted into a movie starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson

Everything Robin Sloan

### Twisted

[Ken Norton on

pronouncement about Puerto Rico this week is truly insidious:

1/ He's a monster, but he’s not lying: he’s making a coherent argument
that many in his party share. And here’s why that’s worse...
