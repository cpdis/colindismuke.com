A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

## Zoom

Professor David Malan transformed Harvard’s CS50 from an introductory
computer science course into a cult and lifestyle brand. The course’s
success and Malan’s methods [provide a
glimpse](https://ofnote.substack.com/publish/post/795689) of where
higher education and the future of learning might be headed in the time
of COVID-19.

> “I think giving David freedom to innovate is really in everybody’s
> best interest. You never know what’s going to come out of it.”

## Election

This was obvious from the day he was elected. Masha Gessen [reviews
Lawrence Douglas’
book](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-could-happen-if-donald-trump-rejects-electoral-defeat)_[Will
He Go? Trump and the Looming Election Meltdown in
2020](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-could-happen-if-donald-trump-rejects-electoral-defeat)._

> Suppose Biden wins. “The best we can expect from President Donald
> Trump after an electoral defeat is self-pitying, peevish submission,”
> Douglas writes. If he goes—which will require an overwhelming
> electoral defeat—Trump is not only sure to play the victim, blaming
> the Deep State and undocumented immigrants for his loss, but also
> likely to linger and delay his departure. The ragged end of his
> Presidency, if it comes, will be full of conflict and resentment.
> There will be no orderly handover, no constructive transition—a
> disastrous prospect during a pandemic and a deep recession, and yet
> another blow to our perceptions of how elections and government
> operate. \
> \
> This is the best-case scenario.

## Day One

An [incredible opening
statement](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/statement-by-jeff-bezos-to-the-u-s-house-committee-on-the-judiciary)
from Jeff Bezos to the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary.

> When I’m 80 and reflecting back, I want to have minimized the number
> of regrets that I have in my life. And most of our regrets are acts of
> omission—the things we didn’t try, the paths untraveled. Those are the
> things that haunt us. And I decided that if I didn’t at least give it
> my best shot, I was going to regret not trying to participate in this
> thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a big deal.

## Liar

I’m thankful for two things:

1.  That Western Australia has done amazing job combatting COVID-19.

2.  Our kids are two young to have serious questions about what’s going
    on.

Dan Sinker [on many parent’s current
reality](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a33379355/parenting-coronavirus-lying-to-kids/):

> My five-year-old understands the reality of our uniquely American
> failure in a way that the president does not: for him, this year is
> gone, lost in a way that no child should ever have to know, and yet an
> impossible number of them now do.

## Race

[Inside Sarah Gilbert’s race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine at the
University of
Oxford](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-07-15/oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-coronavirus-front-runner).
Even after a viable vaccine has been created — the logistics of
distributing it quickly and efficiently are mind-boggling.

> Producing millions, if not billions, of doses of the vaccine may be
> the biggest challenge in the history of the pharmaceutical industry.
> AstraZeneca is signing production agreements with companies worldwide,
> including Oxford Biomedica Plc, a small gene and cell therapy company
> a 10-minute drive from the Jenner Institute. Oxford Biomedica has
> agreed to produce several million doses, with potential to scale up
> into the tens of millions if it works. James Miskin, the company’s
> chief technical officer, describes a multistep production process that
> sounds to my layperson’s ears like a cross between making a sourdough
> starter and boiling down sap to make maple syrup.

## Failure

Surrounding yourself with yes men and women might not be the best idea
as President of the United States. [Inside the Trump administration’s
failure to address
COVID-19](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-response-failure-leadership.html).

> Dr. Birx’s belief that the United States would mirror Italy turned out
> to be disastrously wrong. The Italians had been almost entirely
> compliant with stay-at-home orders and social distancing, squelching
> new infections to negligible levels before the country slowly
> reopened. Americans, by contrast, began backing away by late April
> from what social distancing efforts they had been making, egged on by
> Mr. Trump. \
> \
> The difference was critical. As communities across the United States
> raced to reopen, the daily number of new cases barely dropped below
> 20,000 in early May. The virus was still circulating across the
> country. \
> \
> Italy’s recovery curve, it turned out, looked nothing like the
> American one.

## Grief

That [this essay was written in The New England Journal of
Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2016293) is
alarming.

> The morning you die, I don’t want to be there — like most mornings
> now, when I rise against my whole will and crawl dejectedly into
> scrubs. I don’t want to be a plague doctor or a hero on TV. Now on the
> news, White men hold guns and signs that say “live free or die” to
> protest the lockdown. I imagine what they will look like dying on
> vents in ICUs staffed by doctors lacking sleep and proper training,
> soaked in moral fatigue. I imagine what their wives will sound like on
> the phone as they cry and say “Do everything.” I wonder if these wives
> will thank me or tell me to be safe.
