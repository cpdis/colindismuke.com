A few things from around the Internet this week…

### Time

For all the hype around autonomous vehicles I think
[this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-07-31/inside-the-life-of-waymo-s-driverless-test-family)
is going to be one of the biggest benefits: reclaiming lost time.

> with him rather than worrying about the road.

### Teamwork

*Robot*: “Americano for John, ready at the bar!”

I think [this is a great
idea](https://www.techinasia.com/china-robot-coffee-shop-startup-ratio)
for mass-market coffee shops like Starbucks and Luckin but good baristas
and bartenders are irreplaceable.

> There are no baristas to be seen at a coffee shop called Ratio in
> downtown Shanghai – and no cash desk queue. To get their caffeine fix,
> people perform a ritual that has become increasingly common across
> China: whip out their phones, scan a code at the entrance, place an
> order, and then pay via their mobile.

What these people [were able to
accomplish](http://nymag.com/selectall/amp/2018/08/general-magic-oral-history-of-the-influential-tech-company.html)
in the early 90’s is mindblowing. They were truly ahead of their time.

> **Steve Jarrett**: They all look at each other and one of them says,
> “Honto desu ka?” which is “Can it be true?” The other guy just kind of
> shrugs his shoulders. Then they immediately just start yelling at each
> other in Japanese. One of them jumps up and grabs the telephone that’s
> in the room and yells down the phone. They ask us to stop and wait.
>
> **Tony Fadell**: Just then the boss, Nagasawa-san, comes into the room
> and sees this activity. And as this happens, the loudspeaker goes,
> “Beep beep beep,” and we are like, “What is that?” And somebody says,
> “Oh, there is a typhoon warning. We all need to leave before noon,
> because we need to get home because the typhoon is coming.” I go,
> “Really?” and they go, “Yeah, but we are going to keep working.”
>
> **Steve Jarrett**: Five minutes later, guys in all these multicolor
> factory jumpsuits show up and fll the room. And then they say, “Tony,
> again, please. Please describe your architecture.” So Tony gets to the
> part and he says, “Well, this is where there’s no modem because we’ve
> done it entirely in software.” The one guy grabs his head in his hand
> and just hits his head on the table. I said, “Is everything okay?” The
> guy who organized the meeting says, “You have just obsoleted
> Kato-san’s division.”

### Pure

Come for the [deep dive into ultra-pure
silicon](https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-science-of-ultra-pure-silicon/),
stay for the tale of corporate greed and hubris.

> Intel’s first commercial chip, released in 1971, contained 2,250
> transistors. Today’s computer chips are often packed with transistors
> numbering in the billions. Those tiny electronic squares and
> rectangles are the brains that run our computers, the Internet, and
> the entire digital world. Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, the
> computer systems that underpin the work of everything from the
> Pentagon to your local bank—all of this and much more is based on
> sand, remade as silicon chips.

### Cruel

How does one self-talk themself into believing that these type of petty
mind games are alright? [How Trump radicalized
ICE](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/trump-ice/565772):

> Two minutes later, an officer with a shaved head, a black Under Armour
> hoodie, and a gun on his belt leaned his body through the door to
> stare intently at Ismael. “Why have you been working?” he asked. “We
> know you’ve been working.” It appeared to be an annoyed response to
> the lawyer’s resistance, hurled without evidence, perhaps in the hopes
> of provoking a self-incriminating response. It seemed of a piece with
> the fraught atmosphere in the waiting room. Earlier, there had been an
> announcement that a car was parked illegally outside and needed to be
> moved. Ismael’s lawyer had leaned over to tell me that this would be
> widely presumed to be another trick: Many immigrants under ICE
> scrutiny are not allowed to drive.
