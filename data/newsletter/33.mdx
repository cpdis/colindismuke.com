A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Misguided

[From Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/):

> Indeed, the hidden victims of overly broad regulation focused on
> companies like YouTube and Facebook are all of the infrastructure
> providers that makes sites like Stratechery possible. Any hosting
> provider with a brain — or email service or message board or anything
> that hosts content from users — would be wise to simply block
> Australia completely. [This law is a
> disaster](https://theconversation.com/new-livestreaming-legislation-fails-to-take-into-account-how-the-internet-actually-works-114911),
> and a reminder that tech companies owe it to the Internet to get their
> houses in order before everything becomes far, far worse.
>
> At a time when human talent is so often the binding constraint, and
> amid so many calls to improve the educational system, these kinds of
> ideas deserve further attention.

### Disney

It's infeasible but I would give every one a private jet—it's a
transformative experience. [Abigail Disney on what it’s like to grow up
with unimaginable
wealth](https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/abigail-disney-has-more-money-than-shell-ever-spend.html):

> Actually, having a jet is a really big deal. If I were queen of the
> world, I would pass a law against private jets, because they enable
> you to get around a certain reality. You don’t have to go through an
> airport terminal, you don’t have to interact, you don’t have to be
> patient, you don’t have to be uncomfortable. These are the things that
> remind us we’re human.

### Attack

[Tim Maughan asks the
question](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbw9db/could-we-blow-up-the-internet):
is the Internet really unbreakable?

> It’s both an exciting and frightening idea, that activists and protest
> groups—rather than military, paramilitary, or nation state
> forces—might be able to cause disruption and chaos via DIY methods of
> attacking internet infrastructure, but how realistic is it really?

### Detail

There is [only one
copy](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/laser-scans-could-help-rebuild-notre-dame-cathedral/587230/)
of the highest resolution scan of the Notre Dame Cathedral which could
be integral as it is rebuilt.

> Blaer estimated that, despite the high resolution of the scans and
> panoramic photographs, the files would be roughly a terabyte, small
> enough to fit on a single hard drive, but unlikely to be stored in the
> cloud. All those data now exist on a single disk, a tiny portal into
> the past, which is sitting somewhere on Earth. Blaer thought it might
> be in the hands of Tallon’s students at Vassar. But Ochsendorf thought
> the data were most likely with the rest of Tallon’s archive, in the
> possession of his widow, Marie, who held Andrew in her arms as he
> died.

### Huge

Two tweets about the [first image of a black hole ever
captured](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/10/black-hole-picture-captured-for-first-time-in-space-breakthrough).

Here's the moment when the first black hole image was processed, from
the eyes of researcher Katie Bouman. \#EHTBlackHole \#BlackHoleDay

The black spot in this image is larger in diameter than our solar
system. It weighs more than our galaxy. Its halo is matter literally
being ripped apart and accelerated to near light speed as it disappears,
forever, into a gravitational prison from which there is no escape.

### Crypto

[Deep dive on how Banksy authenticates his (or her)
work](https://reprage.com/post/how-banksy-authenticates-his-work):

> Can an information system be art? Because, like I said, it’s flipping
> sweet, and all executed in Banksy’s trademark tongue in cheek style.
> This whole authentication process would easily be my favourite artwork
> by Banksy.

### Perk

[I think this is a really great, original (to me)
take](https://nadiaeghbal.com/perks):

> Sometimes I think of Kickstarter as the original sin for modern
> patronage. Kickstarter, with its fundraising goals, email updates, and
> reward tiers, inadvertently created a blueprint for every other
> crowdfunding platform thereafter. But we never stopped to think about
> whether we repeated these behaviors because they were actually good
> for creators, or because that’s just how Kickstarter did it.
