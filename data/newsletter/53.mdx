A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

## Home Screens

Is life where anything can be delivered, work and school can be done
from home, and entertainment delivered through the Internet [really what
we want](https://reallifemag.com/home-screens/)?

> When the formal quarantine came, it seemed like domestic cozy was
> fully coming into its own. Much of the necessary infrastructure was
> already in place. The world that tech companies had built and
> persistently tried to persuade us we wanted was waiting for us, ready
> to fully take over. It was consumer-facing disaster capitalism in
> action. […]
>
> Pure economic exchanges can relocate to screen interactions with a
> minimal loss of fidelity, but encounters meant to be less instrumental
> are proving harder to sustain without the texture of physical space.
> Most of the apps we use for interaction simply unbundle an
> informational component from the scene of social contact. […]
>
> “With people told to work from home and stay away from others, the
> pandemic has deepened reliance on services from the technology
> industry’s biggest companies while accelerating trends that were
> already benefiting them.” […]
>
> Pandemics, beyond their direct consequences for those who get sick,
> heighten fear, paranoia, isolation, xenophobia, economic
> vulnerability, and depression. If some tech companies complement such
> a world well, we should ask why.

## Wealth

## Bye

You don’t often see a high-level, high-profile executive like Tim Bray
[publicly quit or
resign](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon),
especially over the treatment of workers making many multiples less than
him. That makes it even more refreshing to see.

> “Kill the messenger.”

> “Never heard of the Streisand effect.”

> “Designed to create a climate of fear.”

## Stuck

Scott Alexander with a few examples of why [he thinks the American
healthcare system is broken for
everyone](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/24/employer-provided-health-insurance-delenda-est/).

> Any other system would fix these problems. A public system like
> Medicare For All would fix them. A communal system like the Amish have
> would fix them. A free market system like our grandparents had would
> fix them. The [prepaid doctor
> cooperatives](https://reason.com/2020/04/05/how-doctors-broke-health-care/)
> Reason talks about would fix them. A half-assed compromise like Joe
> Biden’s Medicare For All Who Want It would fix them. But here we are,
> stuck with a system that somehow manages to fail everybody for
> different reasons

## Amish Health

And Scott Alexander [on a healthcare system within the US that may
actually work
well](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/20/the-amish-health-care-system/).

> Amish people spend only a fifth as much as you do on health care, and
> they outperform us on almost every health metric. What can we learn
> from them? They can share health care costs the way they want,
> ignoring any regulations to the contrary. They are genuinely on their
> own. So, they’ve ended up with a simple system based on church aid.
> Everyone pays tithes to their congregation (though they don’t call it
> that). The churches meet in houses and have volunteer leaders, so
> expenses are minimal. Most of the money goes to “alms,” which the
> bishop distributes to members in need. This replaces the social safety
> net, including health insurance. Most Amish people go their entire
> lives without needing anything else. About a third of Amish people are
> part of a more formal insurance-like institution called Amish Hospital
> Aid (AHA). Individuals and families pay a fixed fee to the
> organization, which is not-for-profit and run by an unpaid board of
> all-male elders. If they need hospital care, AHA will pay for it.

## Cubic

[Your tax dollars at work](https://www.whitehouse.gov/).

I would bet \$538 that the White House's "cubic model" is literally just
an MS-EXCEL trendline with a third-degree (cubic) polynomial.

Josh Dawsey @jdawsey1

A draft report prepared by Johns Hopkins researchers for the CDC shows
200K deaths by June 1. White House does not agree. A "cubic model"
prepared by White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett &amp; team
predicts deaths essentially stop by May 15. Our latest:
