A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Equal

[This is a great
idea](https://summation.net/2019/03/27/what-would-happen-if-all-job-offers-had-to-be-quoted-post-tax-and-in-ppp-adjusted-dollars-thought-experiment-on-compensation/).

> Imagine that there was a law that forced every employer to quote both
> the absolute salary (like \$120,000 in SF) and the after-tax
> PPP-adjusted salary (would transform to probably \$50,000 in SF). What
> would happen?

### Future

I’ve long thought that the ideal form of health and exercise monitoring
would be a small sensor placed underneath the skin, however, [a
super-powered hearing aid might work just as
well](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-04-18/the-future-of-wearable-tech-is-called-a-hearing-aid).

> Sawalich is fond of saying that Starkey makes a product nobody wants.
> Almost two-thirds of the people in America who need hearing aids don’t
> have them, and those who do accept their fate wait an average of seven
> years from the first symptom before seeking help. “With these, hearing
> aids are going to evolve,” he says, “so that you don’t have to have
> hearing loss to want a hearing aid.”

### Silent

[This is
terrifying](https://www.soundingsonline.com/voices/drowning-doesnt-look-like-drowning):

> How did this captain know — from 50 feet away — what the father
> couldn’t recognize from just 10? Drowning is not the violent,
> splashing call for help that most people expect. The captain was
> trained to recognize drowning by experts and years of experience. The
> father, on the other hand, learned what drowning looks like by
> watching television.

### Cult

[A mom’s story of how her teenage son became enamored with and joined
the
alt-right](https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/05/05/what-happened-after-my-13-year-old-son-joined-the-alt-right):

> Who was living upstairs in the room with the bunk beds, surrounded by
> glow-in-the-dark solar-system decals? I couldn’t understand how this
> had happened. The situation was ludicrously overdetermined, as
> contrived as a bad movie. My husband and I poured everything we had
> into nurturing an empathetic, observant child. Until then, it had
> seemed to be working. Teachers and family friends had always commented
> on Sam’s kindness and especially his gentleness toward the “underdog.”
> Then an internet chorus of alt-right sirens sings their song of
> American History X to my kid and he turns into the evil twin of Alex
> P. Keaton: merciless, intolerant, unwilling to extend the benefit of
> the doubt to anyone.
>
> The pendulum had swung. And now it was stuck.

### Magic

[What a time to be alive,
right?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/01/magazine/remington-guns-jobs-huntsville.html)

> In order to buy Remington, Cerberus, as most private-equity firms
> would, created a new entity, a holding company. Instead of Cerberus
> buying a gun company, Cerberus put money into the holding company, and
> the holding company bought Remington. The entities were related but —
> and this was crucial — each could borrow money independently. In 2010,
> Cerberus had the holding company borrow \$225 million from an
> undisclosed group of lenders, most likely hedge funds. Because this
> loan was risky — the lenders would be paid only if Remington made a
> lot of money or was sold — the holding company offered a generous
> interest rate of around 11 percent, much higher than a typical
> corporate loan. When the interest payments were due, the holding
> company paid them not in cash but with paid-in-kind notes, that is,
> with more debt. These are known as PIK notes.
>
> The holding company now had \$225 million in borrowed cash. Cerberus,
> meanwhile, owned most of the shares of the holding company’s stock,
> basically slips of paper they acquired when they created the holding
> company. The handoff happened next: The holding company spent most of
> the \$225 million buying back its own stock, effectively transferring
> all the borrowed cash to Cerberus. Cerberus would keep that money no
> matter what.

### Reverse

[It’s amazing how public sentiment can change an entire
story](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/inside-the-mark-zuckerberg-winklevoss-twins-cage-match).

> The irony of the situation is not lost on me; not only that
> Zuckerberg’s and the twins’ roles as the rebels versus the evil Empire
> seem to have been reversed, but also that *The Accidental
> Billionaires* and the film that followed helped enshrine an image of
> the twins that is in desperate need of revision. It is now my opinion
> that Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss didn’t just happen to be standing in
> the exact right place at the exact right time—twice.
