A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

## Pizza Toast

Craig Mod has a pizza toast obsession that grew into a Showa obsession,
a kissa obsession, and then a community hub and aging population and
“shuttered town” obsession. [Really beautiful
writing](https://www.eater.com/2019/12/16/21003452/japan-kissaten-traditional-cafes-pizza-toast-travel).

> Warnings that implore parents not to leave their infants in their cars
> as they play, hypnotized for hours by small metal balls. This was the
> belt of Japanese road I had now been walking for two days. A belt
> where parents accidentally roasted their children.
>
> But then that stretch of sin and sameness fell away. Homes, small
> gardens, marks of human scale began to appear, and just outside of
> Gifu city proper, I spotted a sign. A tiny square with modernist
> design impulses that spelled out “Yashiro” in Japanese. As I neared
> and saw the gently radiused windows, the petite frosted-glass globe
> above the doorway, I was pretty certain they’d have what I was looking
> for: pizza toast.

## Darts

Come for the[incredibly bad predictions that are compiled in this
post](https://rpseawright.wordpress.com/2020/01/02/forecasting-follies-2020/),
stay for a great summary of the book
[Superforecasting](https://amzn.to/2Ne7Zsy).

> Before you make serious portfolio changes based upon some urgent
> warning, be sure you are well aware of the risks and opportunity costs
> of doing so…and make sure you know the full and complete track record
> of the forecaster upon which you are relying. Very few “expert”
> forecasters will talk about their misses. And they all have lots of
> misses.

## Assassin Marketplace

The future is going to be great. Brian Merchant [reports on online
assassination
marketplaces](https://harpers.org/archive/2020/01/click-here-to-kill-dark-web-hitman/)
and the very real people that are being targeted.

> She fidgeted in her seat, and when she spoke, she mostly looked down
> at her plate. Seeing her in person made it abundantly clear: whoever
> had targeted Stern had succeeded in shattering her sense of security
> and well-being.

## Drowning

Everything in personal finance is relative. Auren Hoffman [writes about
individuals that are financially drowning while making \$300,000+ per
year](https://summation.net/2020/01/08/financially-drowning-on-300k-a-year/).

> As is the case with privilege in any form, one cannot speak of it as
> it is essentially a heretical topic. 95% of Americans would slap you
> in the face if you told them you made \$300k a year and were having
> money problems. Most would gladly trade places with you in a
> heartbeat. Nevertheless, it helps to understand the history and
> metrics we use to we measure income disparity at the very top – how
> can we quantify who is struggling when people are making enormous sums
> of money?

## PJs

I remember reading about parajumpers in high school—maybe in some
alternative universe I actually followed through on that interest and
became [one of these
cowboys](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a28692306/us-air-force-pararescue-tamar-rescue-mission/).

> For many across the armed forces, however, the PJ is a cowboy. PJs
> embrace the image, tattooing green footprints on their ass cheeks to
> commemorate their wild legacy, the footprints taken after impressions
> PJ helicopters would leave on Vietnamese landing fields. Their wild
> legacy contains numerous exemplars: PJs jumping with patients from
> exploding helicopters, PJs flying into hurricanes and 80-foot waves,
> PJs taking bullets to the head and then returning to combat. One story
> tells of two PJs wrestling in an Afghan hut after a grenade rolled by;
> each tried to shield the other, competing over who should save whom.
> The grenade never detonated.
