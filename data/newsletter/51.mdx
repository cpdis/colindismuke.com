A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

## Unlimited

America’s billionaire class has [seen their wealth increase by
10%](https://www.fastcompany.com/90494347/american-billionaires-have-gotten-280-billion-richer-since-the-start-of-the-covid-19-pandemic)
since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. [Ben
Hunt](https://www.epsilontheory.com/through-no-fault-of-their-own/):

> Could this possibly be a bad idea ... some form of moral hazard ...
> for the federal government to insure the rich investors against
> capital market losses by buying TRILLIONS of dollars in financial
> assets and providing TRILLIONS of dollars in interest-free loans
> liquidity facilities? You know, provided that these losses weren't
> their fault.
>
> LOL.
>
> These are exactly the same people who paid off Goldman Sachs 100 cents
> on the dollar with their AIG losses in 2009. You think they give a
> flying f\*ck what you think about moral hazard or precedent or optics
> or fairness or decency? You think these oligarchs and their
> CNBC/fintwit Renfields care about ANYTHING other than getting their
> MONEY back?’

## Collective

[In this investment memo for Cumberland
Advisors](https://mailchi.mp/cumber.com/cumberland-advisors-market-commentary-covid-19-health-recovery-and-economic-recovery-go-hand-in-hand?e=fdf6aec7bc),
Peter and Jeffrey Gold lay out a plan for a health and economic
recovery.

> For the foreseeable future we need to regard this pandemic as a
> blockage in an all-important river. That river is our lifeline as it
> flows from the mountains to the delta and then to the sea. Imagine
> that this river becomes partially blocked by a mountain collapsing
> into it. What happens? Some of the water gets diverted, creating new
> tributaries. While all or part of the blockage is being removed or
> altered, we can normalize some of the consequences of the blockage. We
> must find new paths around the blockage or, better yet, look for ways
> to put these new waterways to use for our population. They can spur
> new opportunities, like power plants, natural irrigation, recreation,
> commercial fisheries, different modes of transportation, and sources
> of clean water. In a like manner, we must also normalize and harness
> this naturally occurring pandemic as we clear the blockages it has
> caused. Optimally this will be a collective effort and also,
> importantly, be based on the creativity of individuals, whether they
> work in industry, government, or nonprofits, or don’t work at all.

## Update

Peter Attia with the [most straightforward
explanation](https://peterattiamd.com/covid-19-whats-wrong-with-the-models/)
of where we’re currently at in the timeline.

## Visual

[![](https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9a3d881-4dd2-4d6b-8d16-88025998eeb1_600x914.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9a3d881-4dd2-4d6b-8d16-88025998eeb1_600x914.png)

The visuals [in this
explainer](https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/VENTILATORS/oakvekyxvrd/index.html)
are incredible. [Recent
research](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-analysis-recommends-less-reliance-on-ventilators/)
suggests that maybe ventilators aren’t quite as useful as originally
thought, though.

## Hype

The only way that face masks will become widespread in the West is [if
they come become
fashionable](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/face-masks-trend-resale-market/).

> It feels a bit weird to trivialize the face mask as a trend, given
> people are wearing them because they don’t want to catch a
> life-threatening virus. They are not a must-have accessory, but a
> _literal must-have to help avoid, like, dying_. Still, self-expression
> lends itself to any blank canvas, and it goes without saying that some
> masks are cooler than others.

## Leadership

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis gets choked up when he's asked about people
who have compared COVID-19 stay-home orders to Nazism. Polis is
Colorado's first Jewish governor.

The question:

> _We are hearing a lot of reports around here … about neighbors
> reporting on other neighbors for not following the orders … rebellion
> out here against your orders which have been called tyrannical,
> against local health department orders being equated to Naziism. How
> do you react to that? What do you say to those people who are clearly
> getting frustrated with this stay at home order?_

Gov. Polis’ was incredible and included:

> _As a Jewish American who lost family in the holocaust, I’m offended
> by any comparison to Naziism. We act to save lives. The exact opposite
> of the slaughter of six million Jews and many gypsies and Catholics
> and gays and lesbians and Russians and so many others._

He starts to lose his composure, but then regains it.

He follows with:

> _It’s not a contest to see what you can get away with. It’s a contest
> to see how well you can stay at home. By not staying at home, by
> having parties, by congregating, you are not sticking it to the
> government. You are not sticking it to Jared Polis. You are sticking
> it to yourself because you are putting yourself and your loved ones in
> jeopardy and you are prolonging the economic pain and difficulties
> your fellow Coloradans face._

He finishes with:

> _Now is the time for us to act with unity, to act together, to do the
> best that we can …_

This is leadership in the time of crisis. In the midst of a question
that clearly provoked an emotional reaction, Gov. Polis answered the
question incredibly clearly with a positive, thoughtful, and unifying,
rather than divisive and hostile, response.
