### Productivity

[Useful hacks](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/useful-hacks/) from
the Collaborative Fund [blog](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/):

> That story is pervasive. Diets, finances, marketing. Everyone wants a
> shortcut. It’s always been this way, but I suspect it’s getting worse
> as technology inflates our benchmark of how fast results should
> happen. Hacks are appealing because they look like paths to prizes
> without the effort. Which, in the real world, rarely exists.

### Wealth

The whole
[tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) from
Naval Ravikant is worth reading several times:

> Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn
> while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is
> your place in the social hierarchy. Learn to sell. Learn to build. If
> you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

### Narrative

[From the Icarus Moment on Epsilon
Theory](http://www.epsilontheory.com/the-icarus-moment/):

> That’s my algorithm for living in the Cartoon Age, both as an investor
> and as a citizen.
>
> It’s a lonely perch, because it doesn’t scale. You’ll never get rich
> and you’ll never get elected President being long volatility and short
> abstraction. But it’s real. It’s my personal equilibrium.
>
> Everyone sees a hawk and wishes they could fly. But that’s not the
> hawk’s great secret.
>
> The great secret is living such that Being and Doing are as one.
>
> And we can all do that.

To understand the no less than five references in that short quote you
must read the rest of the note and several of the referenced older
notes. It's worth spending a significant amount of time reading and
trying understand the framework that [Ben
Hunt](http://investorfieldguide.com/hunt/) has
[built](http://www.epsilontheory.com/).

### Death

[Anthony Bourdain, travel host and author, is dead at
61](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/business/media/anthony-bourdain-dead.html).
I don't know why, exactly, this resonated with me more than most. I
think maybe because he was so raw and outspoken. I can't help but think
of a quote from this excellent [New Yorker
article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/13/anthony-bourdains-moveable-feast):

> “It’s a gloriously doomed enterprise,” he acknowledged. “I’m in the
> business of finding great places, and then we fuck them up.”

I hope he’s at peace now 🙏
