A few things of note from around the Internet this week:

### Rabbit Hole

[Jenny Odell's
investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/27/style/what-is-inside-this-internet-rabbit-hole.html)
into a particular corner of the strange, spammy Amazon clickbait
landscape, and the equally weird drop-shipping empire that is behind it.

> Recently, one of my students at Stanford told me a strange story. His
> parents, who live in Palo Alto, Calif., had been receiving mysterious
> packages at their house. The packages were all different shapes and
> sizes but each was addressed to “Returns Department, Valley Fountain
> LLC.” I looked into it and found that a company called Valley Fountain
> LLC was indeed listed at his parents’ address. But it also appeared to
> be listed at 235 Montgomery Street, Suite 350, in downtown San
> Francisco. So were 140 other LLCs, most of which were registered in 2015.

### Shock

[Incentives
matter](https://features.propublica.org/weirton/police-shooting-lethal-force-cop-fired-west-virginia):

> Amanda told Mader that while there was no way to accept the loss of
> her brother, she and the family were heartened that the last person
> Williams had spoken with was Mader — someone, she said, who had seen
> the man’s despair and done his best not to worsen it.

### Rage

Again, incentives matter. [Frederic
Filloux](https://mondaynote.com/how-facebook-is-fueling-the-french-populist-rage-27a86acb9d85)
on the populist revolt going on in France:

> Facebook is the most threatening weapon to democracies ever invented.
> Over the last two years, the hijacking of the social network by
> populist groups or parties has tainted about a dozen election
> processes across the world and brought to power a string of populists
> leaders that will have a profound effect on their countries.
