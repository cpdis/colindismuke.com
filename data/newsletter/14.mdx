A few things from around the Internet this week:

David Graeber [ranting about work](http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/)
from a few years ago:

> For instance: in our society, there seems a general rule that, the
> more obviously one's work benefits other people, the less one is
> likely to be paid for it. Again, an objective measure is hard to find,
> but one easy way to get a sense is to ask: what would happen were this
> entire class of people to simply disappear? Say what you like about
> nurses, garbage collectors, or mechanics, it's obvious that were they
> to vanish in a puff of smoke, the results would be immediate and
> catastrophic. A world without teachers or dock-workers would soon be
> in trouble, and even one without science fiction writers or ska
> musicians would clearly be a lesser place. It's not entirely clear how
> humanity would suffer were all private equity CEOs, lobbyists, PR
> researchers, actuaries, telemarketers, bailiffs or legal consultants
> to similarly vanish. (Many suspect it might markedly improve.) Yet
> apart from a handful of well-touted exceptions (doctors), the rule
> holds surprisingly well.

Add this to the list of incredibly important existential threats that no
one is paying attention to while we argue about Trump, Nike, and a
million other useless things. [Whatâ€™s causing the alarming drop in sperm

> The problem is that these chemicals are everywhere. BPA can be found
> in water bottles and food containers and sales receipts. Phthalates
> are even more common: They are in the coatings of pills and
> nutritional supplements; they're used in gelling agents, lubricants,
> binders, emulsifying agents, and suspending agents. Not to mention
> medical devices, detergents and packaging, paint and modeling clay,
> pharmaceuticals and textiles and sex toys and nail polish and liquid
> soap and hair spray. They are used in tubing that processes food, so
> you'll find them in milk, yogurt, sauces, soups, and even, in small
> amounts, in eggs, fruits, vegetables, pasta, noodles, rice, and water.
> The CDC determined that just about everyone in the United States has
> measurable levels of phthalates in his or her bodyâ€”they're

Consistently incredible writing; terribly sobering and depressing. [Ben
Hunt on Epsilon
Theory](https://www.epsilontheory.com/things-fall-apart-part-2/):

> If youâ€™re young in America, you donâ€™t feel the wealth inequality that
> bears down in truth and in spirit on the old non-rich. You donâ€™t feel
> the wealth inequality because you have unlimited credit to live in a
> collegiate or graduate school bubble. If youâ€™re young in America you
> FEEL RICH even as you BECOME POORER. This is not an accident. It is
> part and parcel of the widening gyre of American politics and the
> intentional use of the financial system to buy off young Americans and
> their adult parents. Ditto with Medicare buying off old Americans and
> their adult children. All while making the very rich very richer.
