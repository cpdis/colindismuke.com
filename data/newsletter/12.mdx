A few things of note from around the Internet this week…

### Models

Rusty Guinn [on challenging the
priors](https://www.epsilontheory.com/bayes-and-the-boreen/) that we’ve
built up during times of peace and stability:

> Often, the strong evidence that shuts down our questions looks like a
> long series of seemingly predictive data. Long-term equity returns are
> always positive. Stocks and bonds are negatively correlated. Investors
> should ignore the noise and keep to simple balanced portfolios. Value,
> low volatility, momentum and illiquidity all have a premium. U.S.
> residential real estate prices can’t fall. What we often miss is that
> the boring consistency between posterior and prior was being driven by
> an unexamined inference about the state of the world. In other words,
> the inferences we start from usually reflect a complex system of other
> inferences that we’ve accepted as givens. Wars don’t happen any more.
> Globalism and free trade are here to stay. Racism is dead and gone.
> Central banks have figured out government indebtedness problems.
> Markets are mature and liquid.

### Cult

Douglas Rushkoff, [studier of
cults](http://rushkoff.com/books/coercion), on the [Cult of
Trump](https://medium.com/s/greatescape/the-trump-cult-73b6a0efd0ee):

> For a cult leader I studied in New York, this meant a shift from I am
> not having sex with the women to I am not having sex with underage
> women to I didn’t get the 14-year-old pregnant to it’s ultimately not
> wrong for me to get a 14-year-old pregnant. For Trump, we can trace a
> similar trajectory from there was no collusion to it’s a witch hunt to
> collusion is not a crime anyway. Politicians who have already
> committed to the lesser lies find they must accept the more difficult
> ones. In for a penny, in for a pound. Failure of the administration is
> not an option for Republicans who have made the devil’s bargain. If
> the leader goes down, they go down with him. By the time they realize
> what’s happened, there’s no way out.

### Houston!

Brett Martin [on America’s coolest
city](https://www.gq.com/story/houston-restaurants-capital-of-southern-cool):

> But a good deal of what's happening in Houston feels more organic and
> idiosyncratic than what an urban-studies expert might devise in a
> PowerPoint presentation—an energy that feels born of two major
> factors: one, the growth that has turned the city's diverse but
> discrete bubbles into a series of unavoidable Venn overlaps, allowing
> cultures to clash, cohabitate, and collaborate; the other, a pervading
> sense of independent frontier wildness.

### War

A [terrifying
tale](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world)
of the far-reaching consequences of a modern computer virus:

> For days to come, one of the world’s most complex and interconnected
> distributed machines, underpinning the circulatory system of the
> global economy itself, would remain broken. “It was clear this problem
> was of a magnitude never seen before in global transport,” one Maersk
> customer remembers. “In the history of shipping IT, no one has ever
> gone through such a monumental crisis.”
>
> While many in the security community still see NotPetya’s
> international victims as collateral damage, Cisco’s Craig Williams
> argues that Russia knew full well the extent of the pain the worm
> would inflict internationally. That fallout, he argues, was meant to
> explicitly punish anyone who would dare even to maintain an office
> inside the borders of Russia’s enemy. “Anyone who thinks this was
> accidental is engaged in wishful thinking,” Williams says. “This was a
> piece of malware designed to send a political message: If you do
> business in Ukraine, bad things are going to happen to you.”
