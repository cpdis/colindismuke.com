> Relating to prohibited acts for a physician or applicant for a medical license. [https://t.co/vDhn3JCBkk](https://t.co/vDhn3JCBkk) > &mdash; Texas Laws (@laws_texas) [August 6, 2018](https://twitter.com/laws_texas/status/1026324400512094208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

I created a bot, [@law_texas](https://mobile.twitter.com/laws_texas), that tweets out Texas legislation thatâ€™s currently being considered every 30 minutes or so. Heavily inspired by [@oxangiemarie](https://mobile.twitter.com/oxangiemarie).
