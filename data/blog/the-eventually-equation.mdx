Last year, [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval) had an incredibly popular tweetstorm about getting rich, both literally and metaphorically. From that tweetstorm grew a [podcast](https://nav.al/category/podcast) with [Babak Nivi](https://twitter.com/nivi) (they co-founded AngelList together) in which they explore each of the tweets in the storm.

When discussing the tweet above, Nivi lays out a great summary of what it takes to eventually be successful, and, theoretically, a way to calculate the probability of that future success. **I don’t know if Naval meant that it was literally worth sketching out but that’s how I took it**.

I think looking at the sketched out equation really highlights the importance of learning over a long duration. As with any form of compounding, the longer you can keep playing, the greater the future returns. The variables inside the parentheses matter but are a drop in the bucket compared to life-long pursuit of knowledge and growth.

Alternatively…
