Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Colin Dismuke. Iâ€™m an ocean engineer, software developer, and collector of eclectic interests (just like it says on the front of the box!).

This is my personal site where I drop notes, photographs, and audio about things that I am interested in. Generally speaking this website will capture thoughts I have about technology, photography, learning, business, and my endless obsession with learning and gear (great pair, right?).

The entries on this page arenâ€™t all complete thoughtsâ€”itâ€™s a space for me to post what I like in a place thatâ€™s not controlled by anyone (except me).

If youâ€™d like to get in touch, you can find me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/cpdis), [on Github](http://github.com/cpdis), [on AngelList](https://angel.co/colin-dismuke), [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colindismuke), and [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cpdis/). Iâ€™m **cpdis** pretty much everywhere so, if youâ€™re wondering, thatâ€™s probably me. I publish a [weekly newsletter](https://ofnote.substack.com/) about interesting things I find on the Internet.

I joined [Delmar Systems](http://www.delmarsystems.com/site.php) in 2012 as a member of their engineering team and Iâ€™m moving to Perth, Australia in Spring 2020. Iâ€™ve done a lot of engineering work and traveled all over the world designing and deploying mooring systems. Recently, Iâ€™ve spent a lot more time [building](https://password.coffee/)[things](https://compound.careers/)[on](https://lambdanotes.app/) the [internet](https://getpickem.co/) and graduated from [Lambda Schoolâ€™s](https://lambdaschool.com/) fullstack web development program.

Before that, I spent six years at [Texas A&M](https://engineering.tamu.edu/ocean/) getting a few degrees.

If you like something you read here, please feel free to share it and let me know. Itâ€™s always nice to get feedback ðŸ˜„
